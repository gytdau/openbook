      <h1 class="h"><a id="calibre_link-960"></a><a id="calibre_link-65"></a>PREFACE</h1>

      <p class="p6">THIS IS NOT a source book, not a collection of documents. It is a selection of written and spoken
        utterances on a variety of subjects, grouped according to broad themes and designed to give the reader an
        insight
        into the mind of a man who combined energy of thought and energy of action to an exceptional degree.</p>

      <p class="p6">Since Napoleon felt no urge to expound his thought systematically, this book is made up of many
        fragments, some of them contradictory. I have attempted to show in my Introduction that despite such
        fragmentation
        and contradictions there exists in Napoleon’s thought a unifying pattern. In the book itself, however, I have
        refrained from editorial comment, which might easily seem to establish links and relationships where perhaps
        none
        exist. A few explanatory remarks were necessary here and there, but generally I included only such selections as
        can be readily understood without specialized knowledge or tedious explanations.</p>

      <p class="p6">Whether or not Napoleon seriously intended to invade England, or how he hoped to ruin her economy by
        the Continental System, or how he organized his armies, or who should be given credit for his victory at
        Marengo&mdash;these are interesting questions, but they lie in the historian’s domain and they are not exactly
        uppermost in the minds of non-specialists. The figure of Napoleon himself, on the other hand, his thoughts on
        men,
        society, government, religion, war, politics, art, science, history, and himself&mdash;these are topics of
        undiminished significance and interest in our own time, and they are among those included in this book. A less
        inclusive volume would lack balance; if more inclusive, it would defeat one of its chief purposes, which is to
        hold the interest and stimulate the thought of the intelligent but non-specialized reader.</p>

      <p class="p6">As for the historian, he will find no new facts, but if he hopes to gain some fresh glimpse of
        Napoleon’s mind and thought, he will perhaps be rewarded to some degree. He may, of course, have read all the
        sources on which this volume is based&mdash;but then, he may have read them for a purpose other than that of
        culling Napoleon’s thoughts, and at any rate the abundance of the material is such that many links as well as
        contradictions probably escaped his attention. Or else he may be familiar with one or several of the similar
        collections that have appeared from time to time in the past century and a quarter. But these collections
        generally had ulterior motives&mdash;usually to glorify Napoleon and the memory of his Empire&mdash;and they
        were,
        in any case, addressed to the nineteenth-century public, whose perspective differed not a little from ours. More
        recent compilations frequently are refurbished versions of the older ones. None displays a serious attempt at an
        organic presentation of its material, and none utilizes as great a variety of sources as does this one. Such
        assertions may sound obnoxiously self-assured, but if I could not make them in good faith I would not publish
        this
        book. Moreover, no competing work is now in print in English. The one English work which the present selection
        duplicates to any appreciable extent is Napoleon’s <span class="t14">Letters,</span> edited and translated by J.
        M. Thompson and published in Everyman’s Library (Dutton, 1954). There is, of course, no duplication whatever of
        plan and purpose, and thus it requires no chivalry on my part to recommend Mr. Thompson’s excellent selection.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">The topical organization I chose to adopt requires no justification. Others would have done things
        differently. Even the decision whether to include a quotation under one heading rather than another is an
        individual and personal one. Certain topics&mdash;such as religion&mdash;were considered by Napoleon from so
        many
        angles that they had to be treated under several more general heads. A more lexicographic type of arrangement
        seemed to me artificial and mechanical as well as boring.</p>

      <p class="p6">The physical presentation of the volume requires a word of explanation. The book is divided into
        thirteen general themes; these are divided into subsidiary sections, which in turn are subdivided, for the sake
        of
        logical continuity, into sets of one or more quotations. The sets are numbered consecutively from 1 to 340, and
        the source of each quotation is given under the corresponding numbers in the Sources and Notes at the end of the
        book. Chronological sequence has been observed only within each of these numbered sets, and even there a few
        minor
        exceptions occur. However, the date of each quotation is indicated, either in brackets or in an introductory
        sentence, along with such other information as seemed pertinent&mdash;whether the source is a letter or a
        conversation, and the like. Some additional information may be found in the Notes. As a rule, uniform
        consistency
        has been sacrificed to brevity; where the exact date of an utterance or the name of the recipient of a letter
        seemed informative, they were given; where not, they were omitted. A brief chronology of the main events in
        Napoleon’s career and biographical notes have been placed at the back of the book for the reader’s convenience.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">The sources used fall into three categories: (1) Napoleon’s writings, including autograph
        manuscripts
        and dictations of letters, orders, decisions, bulletins, proclamations, newspaper articles, memoirs,
        commentaries,
        etc.; (2) Napoleon’s oral opinions as given at the Conseil d'état, including stenographic transcripts, official
        minutes, and unofficial notes taken by various councilors; (3) recorded conversations and reminiscences of
        Napoleon’s contemporaries from about 1800 to 1821. The conversations are, of course, of unequal reliability, but
        an attempt has been made to select only those which seemed reasonably plausible or which are corroborated in
        other
        sources.</p>

      <p class="p6">The translation is entirely my own. Several of the quotations, however, are transcribed from sources
        originally published in English, notably those from Dr. O’Meara, one of the Evangelists of Saint Helena. His
        awkward prose, interlarded with Italian and French, is English in name only; I took a few liberties in
        transcribing it.</p>

      <p class="p6">I wish to thank the Librairie Plon for extending permission to use several passages from <span
          class="t14">Mémoires du général Caulaincourt,</span> first published in 1933. These passages appear under Nos.
        59, 75, 121, 205, 226, 231, 245, 254, 259, 265, 319, 322, and 335.</p>

      <p class="p6">There are several other debts of gratitude which I wish to acknowledge here and which I hope I may
        some day repay with interest. I thank Professor Jacques Barzun for the encouragement he gave me, for the time he
        devoted to reading my manuscript, and for the many lucid suggestions he made for its improvement. To my friends
        and colleagues at Columbia University Press&mdash;and in particular to Evelyn Boyce, Eugenia Porter, William
        Bridgwater, Leon E. Seltzer, and Henry H. Wiggins&mdash;I give my thanks for the patient and painstaking care
        with
        which they nursed my manuscript. While assuming sole responsibility for its faults, I credit many improvements
        to
        their suggestions. Lastly, I owe to Barbara Chapman far more than she realizes.</p>

      </h1>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">You ask me, what is this General Bonaparte?...To know what he is, one would have
          to
          be he. Junot to his father,</span> 1793</p>

      <p class="p6">FEW LIVES are as thoroughly documented as Napoleon’s. Yet aside from some general truths, little is
        known with certainty. Even the facts remain in dispute; his thoughts are enigmatic in their apparent
        contradictions; his intentions are mysterious. Napoleon himself foresaw this uncertainty, and he commented: “I
        would have found it very difficult to assert with any degree of truth what was my whole and real intention.”</p>

      <p class="p6">Indeed, why should a great man’s mind and soul be more transparent than those of the most humble and
        obscure? Who knows himself or others with true knowledge? The more we know of a man, the more numerous become
        the
        unanswered questions. And yet the impossibility of obtaining definitive answers should not discourage the
        questioner. As Napoleon remarked when young, <span class="t14">“Why</span> and <span class="t14">how</span> are
        such useful questions that they cannot be asked too often.”</p>

      <p class="p6">Our concern in this book is not with the acts of the man, or with his character or psychology, but
        with his thought and mind. Once expressed, thought is less mysterious than the thinker; the mystery is merely in
        the unexpressed residue. Spinoza is more easily understood than the village idiot. Unfortunately, between
        comprehending Spinoza’s philosophy and comprehending Spinoza’s mind there is a line that cannot be crossed. From
        his thought and from his manner of ordering it we can form some idea of his mind&mdash;but that is all.</p>

      <p class="p6">In the case of Napoleon or of the village idiot the situation is still more complex than with
        Spinoza,
        for no matter what they say, we still keep wondering what they <span class="t14">really</span> think; whereas
        with
        Spinoza, we may be reasonably sure that what he really thinks is precisely what he says. Let us now dismiss the
        idiot (though his presence was not irrelevant): what we have left is a philosopher, to whom thought is an end in
        itself, and a man of action, to whom thought is a means to an end. Philosophers are manipulators of thought;
        action is not their direct concern. Napoleon, no matter how deep his thought, was a manipulator of things and
        men.
        Hence his thought necessarily lacked that rounded, self-contained unity and harmonious order in which the
        philosopher rebuilds the universe and finds his peace. Like Margaret Fuller, Napoleon accepted the universe. He
        was at peace from the outset. Cosmic problems stimulated his fancy without causing him unrest. God, to him, was
        the solution of a socio-political problem, and in religion he saw “the mystery of the social order.”</p>

      <p class="p6">Such absence of system, such intellectual opportunism make Napoleon’s thought as a whole more
        difficult to understand than Spinoza’s. In Spinoza, each thought is a step to another thought; in Napoleon, each
        thought is a step to an action. In Spinoza, each step is difficult, demanding concentrated attention, but the
        view
        from the summit is bathed in the light of all-embracing recognition. In Napoleon, few individual thoughts are
        difficult to grasp. At their best, they afford deep insights&mdash;but never a panoramic vista. This is not to
        say
        that Napoleon’s thought lacks unity or coherence. Yet what unifying principle there is remains unstated,
        implicit,
        hence open to interpretation.</p>

      <p class="p6">In Spinoza’s philosophy, no thought on a given topic can be detached from the context of his whole
        thought without doing it violence. In Napoleon, each thought must be related not so much to the context of his
        other thoughts as to the context of his total activity. In many instances, it should also be related to the
        particular action on which it bears. By “total activity” we mean the total force of energy of which he was
        possessed. For it was the combination of his unique activity with his exceptional but by no means unique
        intellectual powers that made Napoleon what he was.</p>

      <p class="p6">Goethe said that Napoleon’s mind was the greatest the world had ever produced. He could not have
        based
        his judgment on what the Emperor said to him during their two interviews; both men said one or two profundities
        and many platitudes. No&mdash;what Goethe saw in Napoleon was a radiant power of the mind that cut through and
        dispelled the mists of speculation, strip ping all problems down to their simplest elements, discarding all
        obstacles to action:</p>

      <p class="p12"><span class="t15">“What centuries have dimly meditated</span></p>

      <p class="p13"><span class="t15">His mind surveys in brightest clarity;</span></p>

      <p class="p13"><span class="t15">All that is petty has evaporated,</span></p>

      <p class="p14"><span class="t15">Here nothing is of weight save earth and sea.”</span></p>

      <p class="p6">Such admiration is not surprising in the man who made Faust change the translation of John 1:1 from
        “In the beginning was the Word” to “In the beginning was the Deed.” Like the famed sun of Austerlitz, Napoleon’s
        mind stood solitary in a cloudless sky to light up naked action with its brightest rays.</p>

      <p class="p6">The present book, though it shows Napoleon’s mind in action, can afford only occasional glimpses of
        the active man. Even his mental activity is but fragmentarily revealed, for that activity was equally intense
        whether he spoke of questions of general human import or of trivial, practical, and ephemeral
        details&mdash;budgets, bookkeeping, fortifications, civil engineering, army rations, or the procurement of
        remounts. The reader has been spared such topics not merely because they are trivial and dull but chiefly
        because
        they acquire significance only in their totality. Yet those who take the time and trouble to survey the whole of
        Napoleon’s record will be rewarded with the insight that here was a man to whom nothing useful was trivial or
        dull. To the luminous strength of his mind, to its infinite power of concentration, there was no subject, no
        matter how arduous or remote, that could not be learned and conquered. If Napoleon had found it useful to learn
        Sanskrit, tightrope walking, and plumbing, he would have learned Sanskrit, tightrope walking, and
        plumbing&mdash;without an instant’s hesitation or fear. When we consider that virtually everything Napoleon knew
        he had picked up as he went along, we cannot help being awestruck: what we face here is not the divine spark but
        a
        dynamo.</p>

      <p class="p6">The utter fearlessness with which the young and inexperienced general addressed himself to problems
        seemingly beyond a single man’s scope characterizes the heroic element in Napoleon’s mind. There is something of
        a
        Hercules in it. Consider, for instance, how the thirty-year-old First Consul, within a few weeks after taking
        power, established a civil administration which proved to be the one and only stable political institution
        France
        has had in the past century and a half. There are those who see in Napoleon merely the military strong man, the
        dictator, just as Hercules is esteemed for his muscle rather than his brain. Yet exceptional mental powers are
        needed to devise a scheme as simple and bold as Hercules’ method of cleaning out the Augean stables: a graduate
        of
        an agricultural college would never have thought of it. Alexander’s handling of the Gordian knot may seem crude;
        Aristotle never taught him such a trick&mdash;but perhaps he learned it from Diogenes, the great simplifying
        Cynic.</p>

      <p class="p6">After 1805 or so, Napoleon’s mind gradually lost its heroic cast. Instead of approaching new
        problems
        with his usual fearless effort, he was content with capricious pronouncements that brooked no contradiction.
        Then
        came progressive disease, and with it spells of drowsy lethargy which in the end became almost continuous. “How
        I
        have fallen!” he exclaimed in 1820. “I, whose activity knew no limits, whose head never rested! I am plunged in
        a
        lethargic stupor, I must make an effort to raise my eyelids. Sometimes I used to dictate, on different subjects,
        to four or five secretaries who wrote as fast as I spoke. But I was Napoleon then; today I am nothing....I
        vegetate, I no longer live.” Yet even then, almost to his last breath, the old Napoleon revived as soon as his
        mind regained temporary strength. Then all became activity&mdash;dazzling conversation, furious gardening,
        tireless dictation. To his lucid mind, inaction was unbearable.</p>

      <p class="p6">This supreme combination of intellect and energy gave Napoleon’s mind a magnetic, almost
        supernatural
        power&mdash;a power that seems to radiate from his pictured features and endows his very name with magic. If
        modern times have produced a mythological figure, that figure is Napoleon. Abraham Lincoln is a possible rival,
        but as a figure of mythology Napoleon has a great advantage: like the Olympians, he is beyond good and evil, a
        true pagan god, eminently classical and Greek. Lincoln, a Christ-like figure from the backwoods, belongs to a
        different circle.</p>

      <p class="p6">Few men have expressed the Napoleon <span class="t14">mystique</span> so suggestively as Heine in
        these few sentences: “His countenance, too, was of the complexion we find on the marble heads of Greeks and
        Romans. The features were as nobly proportioned as those of ancient statues, and on his face was written: Thou
        shalt have no other god but me.”</p>

      <p class="p6">This <span class="t14">mystique</span> is not to be confused with the so-called Napoleonic legend, a
        political fabrication for which Napoleon himself is only partly responsible. Representing the Emperor as the
        champion of liberal and popular aspirations, the legend helped powerfully in placing Napoleon III on the throne
        and in keeping Bonapartism alive. It appealed to sentimentalists, chauvinists, and naive liberals, but it had
        nothing to do with the Napoleon <span class="t14">mystique</span> of less gullible men&mdash;Byron and Stendhal,
        for instance.</p>

      <p class="p6">Examined one by one, Napoleon’s accomplishments and utterances lose much of their magic. Their
        imperfections and errors, their improvised and derivative nature become only too apparent, and the man’s
        personal
        defects, his boundless egotism, deceitfulness, and callousness stand exposed. The sum of the parts is less than
        the whole. Unfortunately, this analytical “debunking,” if applied to almost any great man (with the possible
        exception of a handful of saints), would similarly divert attention from the majestic outline of the forest to
        the
        imperfection of the trees. A critical examination of a great man’s thought or deeds always leads to the
        ultimate,
        the only really important question: which is the deeper reality&mdash;the whole or the parts? If the answer is,
        the parts, then all greatness stands diminished. But before attempting to answer this question, let us return to
        Napoleon’s thought.</p>

      <p class="p6">The near-supernatural power of his mind, we have postulated, is a quality that has passed into his
        very name. To experience that power, no knowledge of his thought or deeds is necessary; simple imagination
        suffices. In fact, knowledge is a hindrance unless it is fairly extensive: then, by an effort of the mind, the
        scholar is able to apprehend something of the nature of the whole Napoleon and to understand rationally what is
        dimly sensed by the impressionable imagination.</p>

      <p class="p6">The collection of Napoleonic thoughts contained in this volume cannot give such an integral insight
        unless the reader is willing to make an effort of the imagination. On the contrary, it is more likely to furnish
        ammunition to the analytical critic. There is nothing wrong in this tendency; in fact, one of the purposes of
        this
        book is to show Napoleon at his best, at his worst, and in between. But some sort of corrective is needed to
        direct the reader’s attention to the essential coherence of Napoleon’s thought, a coherence which is present
        despite all the contradictions, despite the lack of system, despite the intellectual opportunism. The attempt at
        a
        synthesis in this Introduction does not concern itself with Napoleon’s views on individual topics&mdash;this
        would
        be a mere rehash&mdash;but with the general character of his thought.</p>

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-963"></a><a id="calibre_link-67"></a>II</h2>

      <p class="p6">Napoleon described his mental mechanism in three characteristic conversations.</p>

      <p class="p6">“Work,” he said in 1816, “is my element. I am born and built for work. I have known the limitations
        of
        my legs, I have known the limitations of my eyes; I have never been able to know the limitations of my working
        capacity.”</p>

      <p class="p6">In the same year, in another conversation reported by his companion in exile, Las Cases, “the
        Emperor
        explained the clarity of his ideas and his ability to prolong his occupations indefinitely without experiencing
        fatigue by saying that each object and each business was filed in his head as in a chest of drawers. ‘When I
        wish
        to interrupt one occupation,’ he said, ‘I shut its drawer and open another. They do not mix, and when I am busy
        with one I am not importuned or tired by the other....When I want to sleep, I shut all the drawers, and I am
        fast
        asleep.’”</p>

      <p class="p6">And in 1817 he remarked: “I cannot write well, because my ideas and my hand are in two different
        currents. The ideas go faster, and then good-bye legibility! I can only dictate, and this is convenient, because
        it is as if I were conversing.”</p>

      <p class="p6">Tirelessness, concentration, speed&mdash;these were the characteristics of the mechanism.</p>

      <p class="p6">At first, the mechanism was hampered by the presence of superfluous parts which prevented smooth
        functioning. “In my youth, I had illusions,” said Napoleon on his deathbed. He added: “I got rid of them fast.”
        What were those illusions?</p>

      <p class="p6">They were the illusions of the 1780s, such as the belief that philosophical systems and the
        application of political theories were capable of perfecting society. “Until I was sixteen, I would have fought
        to
        the death for Rousseau.” This is not the place to go into the reasons that made him change his mind. Without the
        French Revolution the break would undoubtedly have been less abrupt. By the time he was twenty-four, he had
        grown
        “old when it comes to the human heart.” “Considering the alternative,” he wrote his brother in 1793, “it is
        better
        to eat than be eaten.” Systems and ideologies he threw overboard and henceforth scornfully belabored them as
        “metaphysics.” Yet it would be wrong to assume that he repudiated his eighteenth-century heritage altogether.
        Privately, he remained a Voltairian deist throughout his life, and if he rejected the notion of human
        perfectibility, he nevertheless clung to the notion of social perfectibility.</p>

      <p class="p6">A great deal of argument is possible as to what, if anything, constituted Napoleon’s political
        philosophy. What is certain is that long before he played any political role he had discarded whatever
        “illusions”
        might have prevented him from playing it. Of man, he conceived no longer in the terms of Locke but rather in
        those
        of Hobbes, Machiavelli, and La Rochefoucauld. “Bah!” became his characteristic exclamation. Fear and
        self-interest
        were to him the underlying motives of all human behavior. All sentiments were conventions. “Savage
        man”&mdash;that
        is, man in the state of nature&mdash;”is a dog.” Civilization was acceptance of law from force of habit or from
        fear. An article in the <span class="t14">Journal des Débats</span> in 1800, dictated or inspired by Napoleon,
        said of him: “He knows that men have always been the same, that nothing can change their nature. It is from the
        past that he will draw his lessons in order to shape the present.”</p>

      <p class="p6">Not that men were wicked or that, as individuals, they did not change. Napoleon repeatedly denied
        such
        assertions. But men were weak, ineffectually selfish, and easily guided, if only their predominant passions were
        flattered. In leaders, however, weakness was a mortal sin. “The strong are good; only the weak are wicked,”
        wrote
        Bonaparte as early as 1791. This maxim was to become a cardinal principle of his politics.</p>

      <p class="p6">In those long daydreaming hours of his formative years, when Napoleon used to “measure his dreams
        with
        the calipers of reason,” letting his imagination roam and then examining whether what he had imagined could be
        translated into reality&mdash;in those hours he also pondered the purpose and the destiny of his life. As to the
        purpose, his answer was definite: “We are born for the enjoyment of life. Happiness is merely the enjoyment of
        life in the manner that conforms best to our nature.” The question, then, was destiny, which is determined by
        “the
        manner that conforms best to our nature.”</p>

      <p class="p6">If we speak here of destiny, we must distinguish it sharply from fate. If anyone feels that there is
        no apparent distinction, let him reflect on the heroic labors, the truly backbreaking efforts that men and
        nations
        have taken upon themselves for the sake of accomplishing what they thought to be their manifest destiny. Destiny
        is carried out, fate is suffered. Fate is ineluctable, destiny is elusive. Let it be said by the way that there
        may be no such thing as either destiny or fate; yet so long as these ideas exist in the minds of men they must
        be
        reckoned with.</p>

      <p class="p6">Exactly what Napoleon conceived his destiny to be is not clear; however, some attempt will be made
        at
        a later point to answer this question. Here it is enough to repeat two of his dicta: “All my life I have
        sacrificed everything&mdash;comfort, self-interest, happiness&mdash;to my destiny.” “Destiny must be
        fulfilled&mdash;<span class="t14">that is my chief doctrine.”</span></p>

      <p class="p6">Fatalism Napoleon dismissed as “just a word.” Fatalism is incompatible with an active nature. He
        did,
        to be sure, refer quite often to his “star,” to “Fortune,” and the like, but these were largely figures of
        speech
        designed to impress both friend and foe with his invincibility. The idea of fate, however, true gambler that he
        was, he accepted&mdash;with a few refinements.</p>

      <p class="p6">If destiny was, in its essence, self-fulfillment, then fate was that element in human affairs which,
        being beyond the reach of the individual, determined ultimate success or failure. “I have made all the
        calculations: fate will do the rest.” “It is success that makes the great man.” Fate had another aspect, too: it
        was the iron necessity by which the man of action was forced to perform certain deeds in order to fulfill his
        destiny; and further, it was the necessity by which one act led to another, thus binding the actor in an
        unbreakable chain. This necessity was the modern equivalent of Fate in Greek tragedy, in which “the heroes were
        guilty without being criminal: they shared in the crimes of the gods.” To the modern hero, fate was simply “the
        nature of things”&mdash;in Napoleon’s own case, politics. “It is politics which leads to catastrophe without
        there
        being a real crime.” And to Goethe he said: “Politics is fate.”</p>

      <p class="p6">Luck is another element in Napoleon’s formula, but not in its ordinary meaning. “A consecutive
        series
        of great actions never is the result of chance and luck; it always is a product of planning and genius....Is it
        because they are lucky that [great men] become great? No, but being great, they have been able to master luck.”
        What is luck? The ability to exploit accidents: “The vulgar would call this luck, but in fact it is the
        characteristic of genius.” It takes genius to be lucky&mdash;the remark is profound. At Maloyaroslavets, when
        catastrophe was about to engulf him, he exclaimed, not, as a lesser man might, “Has my luck failed me?” but
        “Have
        I failed my luck?”</p>

      <p class="p6">Next comes calculation, and on this subject Napoleon was eloquent. He prided himself on never having
        done a deed or spoken a word except from calculation. Since Napoleon was human, his boast must be taken with a
        grain of salt, but even so it was well justified. Lives, feelings, vices, virtues, ideals,
        passions&mdash;everything became mere factors in the great equations of power, war, and politics. Calculation in
        the sense Napoleon meant took on almost metaphysical subtleties, as is common among gamblers. “Military
        science”&mdash;and Napoleon applied the principles of that science to all things&mdash;”military science
        consists
        in first calculating all the possibilities accurately and then in making an almost mathematically exact
        allowance
        for accident. It is on this point that one must make no mistake: a decimal more or less may alter everything.”
      </p>

      <p class="p6">Daring and courage were, of course, qualities equally essential to the leader and to those he led.
        At
        the same time, they were subordinate qualities&mdash;in the led, to discipline; in the leader, to the dictates
        of
        calculation. “Napoleon made sure that he might dare, and dared,” he wrote of himself. Fearlessness in the face
        of
        death was part of his natural equipment, as was indifference to human life: but, he assured Talleyrand, he was
        not
        in the least afraid of committing an act of cowardice provided it were useful to him.</p>

      <p class="p6">Will power? Yes, but in moderation. The will must not go counter to circumstances. The greater a man
        is, the less will he must have and the more he depends on events and circumstances. When the propitious, the
        decisive moment arrives, then the will must act promptly and unhesitatingly. Hesitation is fatal; once an action
        is begun, it must be followed through with the utmost exertion of the will.</p>

      <p class="p6">It is now possible to formulate what Napoleon at one point called “the indeterminate equation,” that
        higher mathematics of the man of destiny and genius&mdash;a mathematics that cannot be learned. In general and
        at
        every step, destiny must be fulfilled by the exploitation of every opportunity, every accident; by the exact
        computation of all the chances, including imponderables; by the precise determination of the decisive moment for
        action. The will must be curbed so as to comply with circumstances, and, after everything humanly possible has
        been done to secure success, the issue must be left to fate. Everything in the formula is relative, variable:
        “To
        every circumstance its own law.” The indeterminate equation itself remains immutable, however, and the
        fulfillment
        of destiny remains the supreme, unalterable principle. For its sake, all other principles may be applied or
        disregarded according to the moment’s need; in it all contradictions are reconciled.</p>

      <p class="p6">There is nothing new about the formula, but two things distinguish Napoleon from others who have
        used
        it: his ruthless consistency in applying it and the ability of his mind to apply it to any given problem with
        almost instantaneous results. “My policies,” he said, “are the result of meditation and of strength.”</p>

      <p class="p6">Since the great man is the product of his time, he depends on vaster trends, on the forces of
        history
        or the destinies of nations. But here we come to what seems a knotty contradiction, for when he speaks of
        nations,
        Napoleon tends to treat destiny and fate as synonyms. Proposing a joint conquest of India to Alexander of
        Russia,
        he wrote: “It is the part of wisdom and of politics to do what destiny ordains and to follow the lead of the
        irresistible march of events.” And in 1812: “Russia is swept along by her fate! Let her destiny be
        accomplished!”
      </p>

      <p class="p6">Closer examination of Napoleon’s mental processes will show that the contradiction is part of his
        elastic formula. First of all, although Napoleon threw out a few suggestive hints concerning the historic
        process,
        he had no settled, systematic ideas on that matter. “History I conquered rather than studied....I spurned what
        was
        of no use [to me], and I seized upon certain conclusions that pleased me.” Thus, according to the occasion,
        history could be “an agreed-upon fiction” and “the only true philosophy.” When it suited his purpose he would go
        to the past “to draw his lessons in order to shape the present”; at another point&mdash;when he seizes the
        dictatorship, in fact&mdash;he exclaims: “Let no one search the past for examples that might slow down our
        advance!” In his hands, history becomes a political tool; its very writing becomes a political service. What
        George Orwell was to call the “rectification of history” was in Napoleon’s eyes the historian’s patriotic duty.
        His pronouncements on history reflect not his convictions but merely the needs of the moment. Still, he clearly
        realized the value history held for the individual man of destiny as his sole guide and teacher. Hidden between
        the lines of his official and contradictory pronouncements there is a subtle and terrible consistency.</p>

      <p class="p6">We must here keep in mind a distinction between the historic role of the individual, the nation, and
        the civilization. As for the individual, it depends merely on circumstances whether the potential man of destiny
        is called upon to play his part; but once he is in control of his career he himself becomes a shaper of
        circumstances. By correctly applying the “indeterminate equation” he can realize his nation’s destiny, subject
        only to the limitations of his abilities and to fate. Yet the first thing he must gauge accurately is precisely
        the destiny of his nation. “If such be the decree of destiny,” he wrote Talleyrand in 1797, “I do not even
        consider it an impossibility that within a few years we may attain such great results [for France] as can be
        glimpsed by an ardent imagination and as only an extremely cool-headed, steadfast, and rational man can carry
        out.” It is difficult to say just how far the cool head dared let the ardent imagination roam at that particular
        point, but there can be little doubt that the eventual vision was that of a universal empire dominated by
        France.
        When it turned out that fate had run counter to France’s destiny, Russia became the new champion in Napoleon’s
        mind. If he were the tsar, he said on Saint Helena, he would be “the master and arbiter of Europe.” For what
        purpose? “To found a new society....Europe is praying for such a good deed. The old order is finished....” And,
        still measuring his dreams with the calipers of reason, he silently began to measure distances on the
        map&mdash;with his calipers.</p>

      <p class="p6">It may be an unfair judgment, but not a farfetched one, to say that in Napoleon’s philosophy the
        destiny of nations was chiefly to serve as the vehicle for the destinies of ambitious men. What is almost
        certain
        is that Napoleon did not link his destiny with that of France because of his love of France; rather, he loved
        France because he had linked his destiny with hers. “France needs me more than I need France,” he said. The
        statement may be interpreted in several ways.</p>

      <p class="p6">Thinking of the empires of Alexander, of the Cæsars, of Charlemagne, Napoleon envisioned himself as
        destined to make France the carrier of a new law and civilization. “You who know history so well,” he said to
        Narbonne in 1812, “are you not struck by the similarities of my government with that of Diocletian&mdash;that
        tight-knit web of government that I am spreading over such distances, those all-seeing eyes of the Emperor, that
        civil authority which I have been obliged to keep all-powerful in the midst of an entirely military empire?” And
        indeed, no matter how lyrical he grew on the subject of the art of war, of military conquest, of soldierly
        virtues, Napoleon continually and consistently emphasized that it was as a civil leader, a lawgiver, a
        representative of the spirit rather than the sword that he had taken upon himself the guidance of the destinies
        of
        France. His utterances on military rule verge on sheer antimilitarism.</p>

      <p class="p6">By what may seem to be a detour we are led to Napoleon’s conception of the historic role of
        civilization. Civilization in his eyes was man’s gradual habituation to law by dint of tradition and experience.
        “If the large majority wanted to be criminals and defy the law,” he asked, “who would have the power to stop
        them
        or constrain them?” And he answers: Civilization. “Most sentiments are traditions. We experience them because
        they
        have preceded us.” “Virtually not a single human activity is determined by the simple impulse of man’s will.
        From
        childhood on we live under the sway of laws and habits.”</p>

      <p class="p6">But when the laws lag too far behind social change, as at the time of the French Revolution, then a
        volcanic eruption becomes inevitable. “A revolution can be neither made nor stopped. The only thing that can be
        done is for one or several of its children to give it a direction.” He who would guide a revolution must not try
        to follow his own willful preferences: he must go “along with the opinions of the masses and with events.” This
        is
        difficult, for “what the people wants is almost never the same as what the people says. Its will and needs ought
        to be found not so much in the people’s mouth as in the ruler’s heart.” In his own particular instance, what the
        people said it wanted was “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.” Napoleon’s heart was quick to decide that the people
        cared little for liberty and less for fraternity. Equality he saw as the great principle of the nineteenth
        century&mdash;equality and, paradoxically, love of distinction. What Napoleon claimed he gave the people was
        equality of opportunity, which satisfied both conflicting aspirations. He foresaw, somewhat dimly, the rise of a
        capitalist industrial civilization; he predicted both the growth and the end of colonialism; he took notice of
        nationalist aspirations, although he believed, with fatal results to himself, that they could be fanned or
        extinguished at will; and he expressed the conviction that post-revolutionary society was progressing toward a
        higher public morality. With a curious mixture of cynicism and prudishness, he exploited the vices and
        corruption
        of men at the same time that he sternly ordered an improvement of the moral tone. All in all, when it came to
        the
        social order and civilization, Napoleon’s reign foreshadowed that of Queen Victoria.</p>

      <p class="p6">It is not clear here whether Napoleon regarded it as his mission to forward the trends of
        civilization
        or whether he merely exploited these trends for his own advancement. The question is perhaps idle, since the
        identification was complete. The salient characteristic of all of Napoleon’s utterances, on any subject
        whatsoever, no matter how remote, is that by some twist he invariably ends by placing himself at the center. The
        destiny of General Bonaparte, the destiny of France, the destiny of Europe, the destiny of
        civilization&mdash;each
        was, in the last analysis, merely one aspect of the same thing. “He wanted,” said Mme de Staël, “to put his
        gigantic self in the place of humankind.”</p>

      <p class="p6">“Now, in his heart,” says Melville, “Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are sane,
        my
        motive and my object mad.” Napoleon had no glimpse of this whatever. For unlike Captain Ahab, with whom in other
        respects he shows striking similarities, he was not hunting any particular whale. If, as Mme de Staël asserts,
        he
        wanted to put his self in the place of humankind, he did so only by implication, simply because it was in his
        nature to do so, not because he had consciously conceived any such mad object.</p>

      <p class="p6">What, then, was the object of Napoleon’s quest and ambition? He repeatedly answered the question,
        and
        we must believe him: he did not know. At times he even disclaimed ambition altogether. “If I have any
        [ambition],
        it is so natural to me, so innate, so intimately linked with my existence that it is like the blood that
        circulates in my veins, like the air I breathe....I never am obliged to fight either against or for ambition.
        Ambition never is in a greater hurry than I; it merely keeps pace with the circumstances and with my general way
        of thinking.”</p>

      <p class="p6">“It merely keeps pace with circumstances”! To aim at world empire seemed to Napoleon a most natural
        thing. “Who wouldn’t have, in my place?” he asked Benjamin Constant; and later he was to assert that George
        Washington, placed in Napoleon’s circumstances, would have acted exactly as Napoleon did&mdash;or else been a
        fool.</p>

      <p class="p6">Is this, then, the key to the enigma? Is the demigod nothing but a superlative brigand, equipped
        with
        infinite cunning, lying in wait for any prey that comes his way, with no other object in mind than to take as
        much
        as opportunity allows, contemptuous of those who have not sense enough to help themselves likewise? There is no
        lack of those who have thus asserted, and no doubt their argument has weight. Yet in this manner of thinking
        there
        is an element of shallow philistinism. Brigands are concerned with brigandage. Sometimes, they build
        empires&mdash;but that only goes to show that they are not made of the same stuff as other brigands.</p>

      <p class="p6">The best clue to Napoleon’s aim in life lies in his curious way of making budgets&mdash;and “outside
        budgets there is no salvation,” he said. If, for instance, he ordered the construction of some public work or
        edifice, he would make sure that it was built in stages and that at the end of each stage it could be put to
        some
        use, no matter how many years might elapse before the whole was completed. If the wing of a palace, or a stretch
        of road or canal, could be put to use after the first year, then its cost began to be amortized in the following
        year and could be charged off the budget. By the time the whole was completed, it had paid for itself. By this
        sleight of hand, Napoleon combined long-term objectives with his passion for immediate usefulness. He did not
        expect the present generation to sacrifice itself for an indefinite future, nor did he wish future generations
        to
        pay the debts of the present. Such husbanding does not bespeak an unprincipled mind. In precisely the same
        manner,
        he seems to have looked upon his destiny as something that was revealed to him in installments, as the occasion
        arose. Each installment had to pay for itself, regardless of what the future might bring. To look too far beyond
        the present installment was futile. When the last installment came and he sat dying for six years on his rock,
        he
        still regarded it as a positive stage in his destiny. “My downfall raises me to infinite heights,” he said. It
        was
        an amortization of immortality.</p>

      <p class="p6">Napoleon was not one to eschew the ultimate questions. Even if, at the cost of colossal effort, his
        earthly destiny were accomplished&mdash;what then? There was no paradise for heroes, no Elysian Fields that he
        believed in, not even Heaven and Hell. “There is no immortality but the memory that is left in the minds of
        men.”
        To have lived without glory, without leaving a trace of one’s existence, “is not to have lived at all.” Glory,
        “the sun of the dead” in Victor Hugo’s phrase, is a chilly star, and all greatness is sad, as Napoleon remarked
        when he moved into the gloomy Tuileries palace. Yet neither greatness nor glory is a matter of choice. To be
        great
        was for Napoleon to live in conformity with his nature. The end was the same for all, nonbeing; but to live
        without the consciousness that his memory would endure was, as he put it, to die every day. Nobody wants to die
        every day. It is better to live and seek the impossible. Moreover, while it is true that the sun of the dead
        does
        not warm their bones, it is equally true that the prospect of immortal glory warms the hearts of the living. “I
        should like,” said Napoleon, “to be my own posterity and to see how a great playwright like Corneille would make
        me feel, think, and speak.”</p>

      <p class="p6">Vanity, saith the Preacher, all is vanity!</p>

      <p class="p6">Napoleon remembered his Plutarch well. The conversation between Pyrrhus and Cineas was ever fresh in
        his mind. When Pyrrhus prepared to make war on Rome, his ambassador Cineas asked him what he would do after
        defeating the Romans. Conquer Italy, said Pyrrhus. And after that, what? Sicily. And then? Carthage. And when
        all
        this was done, and Greece subjugated as well, what then? Then, said Pyrrhus, “We will live at our ease and drink
        all day, and divert ourselves with pleasant conversation.” Then why, asked Cineas, go through so many troubles,
        if
        Pyrrhus could enjoy these pleasures at that very moment? Such reasonings, Plutarch informs us, disturbed Pyrrhus
        but in no way altered his purpose. Still, although like Pyrrhus Napoleon never wavered in his purpose to make
        conquests that would leave him no happier than he was when he started out, the vanity of such aimless
        purposefulness did not escape him. Nor, being a child of the eighteenth century, could he endure the notion of a
        man, be he ever so superior, seeking no other end than to magnify his ego. Glory without nobility of purpose was
        nothing. And thus, on his deathbed, the great cynic, the great opportunist concluded his political testament for
        the benefit of his son as follows: “No matter what he learns, he will profit little from it if in his innermost
        heart he lacks that sacred flame, that love of the good which alone inspires great deeds.”</p>

      <p class="p6">Let us not be more cynical than Napoleon. Let us accept these words on trust.</p>

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-964"></a><a id="calibre_link-68"></a>III</h2>

      <p class="p6">This seems to be as far as it is possible to go in suggesting the unity of Napoleon’s thought. As
        soon
        as one passes from the theme of destiny and self-fulfillment to more specific things, contradictions multiply
        and
        interpretations become hazardous. Indeed, the general method of his thought not only allows but even prescribes
        self-contradictions, lies, and posturings. These are spread for the reader to see in every part of this book.
        The
        reader can make of them what he pleases, but he should not judge Napoleon by them. Little men tell little lies,
        great men tell big ones. “It is an almost instinctive belief of mine,” writes Stendhal, “that any man who holds
        power lies when he speaks, and especially when he writes.” And Melville, with equal sagacity, remarks, “For be a
        man’s intellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over other
        men, without the aid of some external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and
        base.”</p>

      <p class="p6">Though not directly relevant here, the question might be asked with some profit: Why did Napoleon
        fail? “Because he bothered God,” said Victor Hugo. That is one answer. Others point to this or that mistake or
        miscalculation, or declare that Napoleon bit off more than he could chew, or find some basic flaw in his system,
        or see him succumb to irresistible historic forces, or maintain that his people and allies let him down, or
        descry
        in his defeat the triumph of good over evil, or shrug their shoulders and speak of bad luck. Still others
        maintain
        that his rise was a historic accident and that his downfall merely cut him down to size. Perhaps. If we accept
        as
        a premise the fact that he did fail, then all or any of these reasons may have been decisive. But did he fail?
      </p>

      <p class="p6">As to military success, there can be no question of his ultimate failure. Yet Napoleon was
        singularly
        unconcerned with ultimate results. Just as Pyrrhus declared that after making all his conquests he would return
        home and live in merry comfort, so Napoleon persistently returned to the theme of what he would have done had he
        consolidated his empire and made peace. Democracy would have been established, along with liberty and social
        benefits&mdash;and so forth. No doubt such declarations were intended as propaganda for a possible return, but
        to
        some extent he seems to have believed in these chimeras. Pyrrhus might have answered Cineas, his Talleyrand,
        that
        if he followed his advice history would not speak of him&mdash;but probably he did not think it worth his while
        to
        argue the matter. Fear of oblivion was also Napoleon’s motive, although some time before his downfall he
        rationalized this fear with the help of a political argument. “My power is dependent on my glory,” he said, “and
        my glory on my victories....A newly established government must dazzle and astonish. The moment it ceases to
        glitter, it falls.” This argument is highly debatable, but since it explains the inner compulsion that drives
        modern dictators to reckless adventure it should be ever-present in our minds as a warning.</p>

      <p class="p6">The peaceful idyl visualized at the end of the long struggle is the grand illusion of restless
        doers.
        Even so, it is not for such idyls that the Pyrrhuses and Napoleons sacrifice their repose. In fact, they have no
        repose to sacrifice, since they are embodiments of the principles of energy and activity. But an activity that
        has
        only itself as its real and principal object cannot be judged by the criteria of success or failure. It is in
        this
        sense that Goethe must be understood when he spoke of Napoleon as a natural phenomenon beyond the laws of men.
        This is also what Napoleon meant when he said: “I am a fragment of rock thrown into space.” It would make little
        sense to speak of successful or unsuccessful meteors, thunderstorms, or volcanoes. Still, as Napoleon pointed
        out,
        all men are the product of civilization; and, being a man, Napoleon paid tribute to civilization by entertaining
        a
        grand, humanitarian illusion. He might have dreamed of a Hitlerian nightmare instead; but since he was a product
        of the eighteenth century, he preferred to daydream of peace, happiness, and justice.</p>

      <p class="p6">There was yet another reason, and perhaps a more significant one, for Napoleon’s material failure,
        and
        this was his essentially artistic temperament.</p>

      <p class="p6">“Bonaparte was a poet in action,” said Chateaubriand. Similar remarks have been made on many men,
        and
        without elaboration they remain empty phrases. The defrauding bank teller who keeps a mistress and bets on
        horses
        may regard himself as a poet in action, too. Such ambiguities spring from the popular notion that it is defiance
        of law and convention which constitutes the artistic temperament. But the opposite is closer to the truth: the
        artist’s temperament is characterized by his dissatisfaction with the disorderly nature of the world such as he
        finds it. He creates his own world, with laws and conventions far more absolute than those of the world of men.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">Napoleon made a remark on the fine arts that struck his contemporaries as ignorant but that to
        modern
        ears sounds almost axiomatic. What is so admirable in a painting or a piece of sculpture? he asked. “They all
        are
        mere copies from nature, and there is little merit in copying or imitating.” Indeed, we find that the world that
        Napoleon recreated in his own mind bears little resemblance to the “real” world. Paradoxically, the great
        realist,
        the scorner of systems and metaphysical abstractions appears to have had a vision of the world that no realist
        could share. In his “romantic and epic dream”&mdash;the words are his&mdash;he created a hero to suit the needs
        of
        his imagination, a humanity to suit the needs of his hero, and a background to suit the magnitude of the action.
        Sir Hudson Lowe, no fool no matter what else he was, said that Bonaparte had created an imaginary Napoleon, an
        imaginary Europe, and, in the end, an imaginary Saint Helena. Few truer things have been said of Napoleon.</p>

      <p class="p6">Leaving the hero till last, let us look at the humanity and at the background of Napoleon’s
        imaginary
        world. Men are raw material that can be manipulated; they “are like ciphers; they acquire their value merely
        from
        their position.” When properly employed by the hero, they are capable of great and noble deeds: “the inspired
        minority triumphs over the inert masses.” When opposing the hero’s designs, they are base, weak, and easily
        disposed of. Their aspirations, their opinions can by turns be exploited or ignored. Nations can be played off
        against one another, and alliances can be interchanged like articles of clothing. Selfishness and fear prevent
        men
        from concerting their actions against the hero. Since human nature in the aggregate does not change, the hero
        can
        continue to manipulate men and nations indefinitely. Such an estimate of men was necessary for the purposes of
        the
        hero, but it resulted in costly miscalculations. Men, it turned out, were less malleable than clay, less even
        than
        marble. This, however, did not disturb Napoleon&mdash;for reasons we shall presently try to make clear.</p>

      <p class="p6">As for the background against which Napoleon saw himself, it was a unique vision. “Here nothing was
        of
        weight save earth and sea,” as Goethe put it. Napoleon’s imagination was in its element only when it roamed
        immensity. “Immensity,” in fact, was one of his favorite words. A pond in Moravia became an “immense lake” as he
        dictated a bulletin. “Vastness and immensity can make you forget a great many defects.” The desert fascinated
        him
        as a “symbol of immensity,” as a “motionless ocean,” and desert and ocean were the favorite objects of his
        contemplation. He used to like Ossian “for the same reason that I like the whisper of the wind and the waves of
        the sea.” His very style achieved a romantic sort of poetry when shapeless vastness was its subject: “The soul
        was
        suspended between eternity, the ocean, and the night.” The Moscow fire was “like immense waves of the sea,
        alternately bursting forth and lifting themselves to skies of fire, and then sinking into the ocean of flame
        below.” Always the sea! An unfinished novel he undertook in his youth began with a storm at sea. Appropriately,
        he
        died during a storm in the middle of the Atlantic.</p>

      <p class="p6">With this romantic and poetic backdrop, the action itself&mdash;politics and war&mdash;took on an
        essentially artistic character. In defining his conception of generalship in terms of a mathematical equation,
        Napoleon also defined the essence of artistic creation: “Now, this apportioning of knowledge and accident can
        take
        place only in the head of a genius, for without it there can be no creation&mdash;<span class="t14">and surely
          the
          greatest improvisation of the human mind is that which gives existence to the non-existent.”</span></p>

      <p class="p6">The artist in politics and war was also an artist in power. “I too love power&mdash;but I love it as
        an artist. I love it as a musician loves his violin. I love it for the sake of drawing sounds, chords, and
        harmonies from it.” The material source of his power was France. Of her he spoke as an artist of his Muse or a
        spendthrift of his rich mistress (there is little difference): “I have only one passion, only one mistress, and
        that is France: I sleep with her. She has never failed me....If I need five hundred thousand men, she gives them
        to me.” There is something appalling in the egocentricity of artists.</p>

      <p class="p6">We return to our starting point&mdash;the hero and the myth. For the chief object of the artistic
        creation, the non-existent that had to be given existence, was, of course, the hero. As the Garden of Eden with
        its animals and fruits was created for Adam, so that world of immense potentiality, peopled by manageable
        humans,
        was created for the mythical Napoleon. The fact that men ultimately proved rebellious and that the career across
        limitless deserts and oceans ended in confinement on a rocky island&mdash;all this, as has been hinted, did not
        matter to him, for his true object had been accomplished. The myth had been given life, the non-existent called
        into existence, and nothing could shake it. The would-be destroyer of the myth “will be biting into granite....I
        shall survive&mdash;and whenever they want to strike a lofty attitude, they will praise me.”</p>

      <p class="p6">The myth rests not on fiction but on fact. “Arcole, Rivoli, the Pyramids, Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena,
        Friedland&mdash;these are granite: the tooth of envy is powerless there.” Yet even if these facts be hard enough
        to break a mastiff’s teeth, they would be nothing in themselves. What vitality they have in the minds of men is
        owed to the vitality of the mind that made them possible&mdash;the furious mental energy and activity that
        accepted the challenge of every problem, roused or crushed the will of men, and fell short of its objective only
        because that objective was unlimited. Napoleon was the first to appreciate the mythological touch of his end,
        the
        Prometheus-like captivity on his rock; his very liver ailment was Promethean.</p>

      <p class="p6">And the flesh was made word. A name, perhaps merely a symbolic representation of the name&mdash;a
        forelock, a hat, a pose&mdash;these by themselves in the imagination of men suggest the essence of what a
        thousand
        volumes of facts and appreciations cannot convey. Even the all-too-human weaknesses and vices in Napoleon’s
        character&mdash;his awkwardness, his crudeness, his cynicism, his supposed incests&mdash;acquire the Olympian
        indifference of similar vices in Homer’s gods and heroes. “To strike a lofty attitude” one must, if not praise,
        at
        least admire him. To withhold admiration is petty and antipoetic. Except for a few pedants, said Napoleon, no
        one
        denied Alexander the Great’s claim to divinity. Napoleon professed to admire Alexander’s self-deification as a
        politic act; but in his heart he knew better. “Nothing great remains to be done,” he complained in 1804; “...if
        I
        declared myself the son of the Eternal Father...every fishwife would hoot when she saw me pass by. The masses
        are
        too enlightened these days.” But the masses are never too enlightened for a myth. “Napoleon is the Face of God
        in
        the darkness,” wrote the pious Catholic Léon Bloy. And not a fishwife hooted, though Zeus may have smiled.</p>

      <p class="p6">Paoli diagnosed Napoleon’s anachronistic nature when he remarked to him, who was still an obscure
        lieutenant, “There is nothing modern in you; you are entirely out of Plutarch.” It is true that Napoleon
        perfected
        several features of modern totalitarianism, economic warfare, mass propaganda, and other deplorable innovations:
        he marched with events, as he put it. But it is not from these things that his myth has sprung. He captured the
        imagination of those who harked back to&mdash;or looked forward to a return of&mdash;the gods and heroes of the
        ancient world. Alone among modern dictators he conquered mankind not by preaching systems and ideologies, not by
        speeches and demagoguery, not (though he used them) by tenor and secret police&mdash;but by the sheer magnetism
        of
        his personality, by the concentrated application of his mind, by the infectious boldness of his ventures.</p>

      <p class="p6">Certain external and by no means accidental similarities between Napoleon’s career and that of
        Hitler
        have blinded some men to the far more significant contrasts. Unlike Napoleon, Hitler is likely to go down in
        history as another Attila or Jenghiz Khan. Hitler destroyed the law; Napoleon was a lawgiver whose code spread
        across continents. That difference alone should be enough to discourage comparison. Hitler was a maniacal crank
        with an ideology; Napoleon, sane and self-controlled, despised ideologies. Hitler appealed to hatred; Napoleon,
        to
        honor. Hitler extolled that dark, instinctual monster which he called the People and which Taine had called the
        Gorilla; Napoleon had seen that monster in action during the Reign of Terror, and he preferred to perish rather
        than invoke its power. Napoleon, when he began his career, embodied the hopes of sane and noble minds (not least
        among them Beethoven’s); Hitler began and ended surrounded by a handful of psychopaths. But why insist on the
        contrast? Perhaps there is no difference between them but the difference between the Age of Reason and the Age
        of
        Hatred. It’s a substantial difference.</p>

      <p class="p6">Still, since great men have caused much breakage of late and since that breakage is becoming
        increasingly complete, the question has arisen in many men’s minds whether the world would not gladly dispense
        with great men. Napoleon himself wondered about this. “The future will tell us whether it would not have been
        better if neither I nor Rousseau had ever lived,” he said over Rousseau’s grave. But as soon as we condemn great
        men, we condemn exceptional men. Without great men, we have only mediocre men, and if there had never been
        anything but mediocre men, we would still be half-apes. If Hitler is to be condemned merely because he was not a
        law-abiding citizen, content with making money, raising a family, owning a car, and living and letting live,
        then
        Hitler should not be condemned&mdash;or else a Galileo, a Mozart, or even a Gandhi would have to be condemned,
        too. Nor can Hitler be condemned as a great man, because he was not a great man. Things are not so simple, and
        men
        must be judged as individuals, not as members of categories according to the degree of their departure from a
        dubious norm. It is difficult to see how Hitler, as an individual, can be judged as anything but a diseased
        catalyst of a mass disease. Nothing positive appears on the ledger. Napoleon, on the other hand, in his historic
        action left positive achievements behind him. Unlike Hitler, he left Europe not in ruins but brought up to date.
        Even where his genius failed his purpose, its nature was such that it cooperated willy-nilly with the
        constructive
        forces of history; the unification of Germany and of Italy, the spread of democratic liberalism may not have
        been
        in accord with his intentions, but they most certainly owed much to his action. And as a myth and a symbol he
        pushed back the limits of human capabilities. It may be a costly process for humanity to produce Napoleons, but
        if
        humanity should ever cease to produce them it would be a sign that its energies are exhausted. In order to turn
        its Napoleons to better enterprises than conquest and war, humanity first would have to turn away from war. To
        prove Napoleon wrong humanity must change.</p>

        [Conversation, 1815, Saint Helena] You do not know men. They are difficult to understand if you want to be just.
        Do they know themselves, can they explain themselves to themselves? Most of those who have deserted me perhaps
        would, had my luck held out, never have suspected their defection. There are vices and virtues born of
        circumstance.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] It is not true that “men never change.” They change for the worse&mdash;and
        even
        for the better. The same goes for many other maxims hallowed by writers, all equally false. “Men are
        ungrateful,”
        they say. No, it is not true that men are as ungrateful as they are said to be, and if there are many occasions
        for complaint, the usual reason is that the benefactor exacts still more than he gives.</p>

      <p class="p6">Again, you are told that “knowledge of a man’s character is the key to his behavior.” This is false.
        A
        person may commit a crime who is basically an honest man; another inflicts cruelty without being cruel. The fact
        is that men almost never act in natural conformity to their characters but from a momentary secret passion that
        has taken refuge in the farthest recesses of the heart. Another error: you are told that “the face is the mirror
        of the soul.” The truth is that men are very difficult to know and that, to avoid mistakes, they must be judged
        only by their actions and, at that, by the action of the present moment, and only for that moment.</p>

      <p class="p6">In fact, men have their virtues and their vices, their heroism, their perverseness. They are neither
        generally good nor generally bad, but they possess and exercise all that is good and all that is bad in this
        world. There you have the basic principle; its subsequent application operates through disposition, education,
        accidents. Outside this, all is theory, all is error.</p>

        brothers cannot make up their minds to kill him. Judas, coldly hypocritical, cravenly calculating, hands his
        master to the executioner. A philosopher has asserted that men are born evil; it would be a lengthy business,
        and
        a very idle one, to investigate the truth of his saying. What is certain is this: that the mass of society is
        not
        wicked&mdash;for if a large majority wanted to be criminals and to defy the law, who would have the power to
        stop
        them or constrain them? It is precisely in this respect that civilization has triumphed, for indeed that happy
        result is due to the very nature of civilization. Most sentiments are traditions. We experience them because
        they
        have preceded us. Human reason, its development and that of our faculties&mdash;there you have the whole key to
        society, the whole secret of the lawgiver. Only those who want to deceive the masses and to govern for their own
        benefit could wish to maintain them in their ignorance; for the more enlightened the masses are, the more people
        will be convinced of the necessity of the laws and of the need to protect them, and the more settled, happy, and
        prosperous society will be. And if the enlightenment of the masses should ever do harm, this could happen only
        if
        the government, in opposition to the interest of the people, forced them to the wall or reduced the lowest class
        to misery and starvation, for then the more intelligent choice would lie in self-defense or crime.</p>

        [Manuscript, 1791] The ivy clings to the first tree it meets. This, in a few words, is the story of love....</p>

      <p class="p6">A man is in a foreign country, without relatives, away from his home: you may be sure he needs an
        attachment, a support, a feeling that takes the place of his brother, his father [blank space in manuscript].
        Love
        comes to his rescue and offers him those advantages....Well, what is love? The consciousness of his own weakness
        that is never long in taking hold of a solitary or isolated man&mdash;the feeling that he is at the same time
        powerless and immortal. His soul contracts, expands, gathers strength; delightful and voluptuous tears begin to
        flow, and love is there!</p>

      <p class="p6">The gentle emotions of love, Cupid’s treacherous arrows, are poisoned, it is said, but we take

        [Conversation, c. 1805] Josephine is always afraid I might seriously fall in love. It seems she doesn’t know
        that
        love is not made for me. Indeed, what is love? A passion that puts the whole universe to one side in order to
        see
        nothing, to allow nothing on the other side but the object of one’s love. And surely it isn’t in my nature to
        let
        myself go to such exclusiveness. Then why is she concerned over pastimes that do not in the least engage my

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-358"></a><a href="#calibre_link-732"><span class="t16">{21}</span></a>
        [Notebook,
        November 22, 1787] I had just left the Théâtre des Italiens and with long strides was pacing up and down the
        paths
        of the Palais-Royal. My soul, stirred by the vigorous emotions that characterize it, made me indifferent to the
        cold. But my imagination had cooled down; I began to feel the rigor of the season and made for the arcades. I
        was
        on the threshold of those iron gates when my eyes strayed toward a female person. The time of day, her figure,
        her
        extreme youth left me no doubt that she was a streetwalker. I watched her. She stopped, not with the air of a
        veteran but with an air that agreed perfectly with her exterior. This correspondence struck me, and I spoke to
        her. I spoke to her&mdash;I who, more deeply impressed than anyone with the odiousness of her profession, have
        always considered myself soiled by a single look! But her pallor, her frailness, her soft voice kept me from
        hesitating even for an instant. “Either she is a person who will be useful to the study I want to make,” I told
        myself, “or else she is a goose.”</p>

      <p class="p6">“You must be very cold,” I said to her. “How could you muster the courage to go into the garden?”
      </p>

      <p class="p6">“Ah, sir, hope keeps me going. I must finish the evening’s work.” The indifference with which she
        uttered these words, the lethargy of that reply won me, and I walked on with her.</p>

      <p class="p6">“You look as if you had a weak constitution. I am surprised you are not tired of the profession.”
      </p>

      <p class="p6">“Ah well, sir, one has to do something.”</p>

      <p class="p6">“That may be, but isn’t there any profession that is better for your health?”</p>

      <p class="p6">“No, sir, one has got to live.”</p>

      <p class="p6">I was enchanted. I saw that at least she was responsive, and in all my previous attempts I had never
        scored that success.</p>

      <p class="p6">“You must come from some northern province, since you defy the cold.”</p>

      <p class="p6">“I come from Nantes in Brittany.”</p>

      <p class="p6">I know that country. You must, Mademoiselle, do me the favor of telling me how you lost your
        virginity.”</p>

      <p class="p6">“An officer took it from me.”</p>

      <p class="p6">“Do you regret it?”</p>

      <p class="p6">“Oh yes, you may believe me.” (Her voice took on a savor, an unctuousness that I had not yet
        noticed.)
        “You may believe me. My sister is well married now. Why shouldn’t I have been too?”</p>

      <p class="p6">“How did you come to Paris?”</p>

      <p class="p6">“The officer who dishonored me, whom I hate, abandoned me. I had to flee my mother’s indignation.
        Another turned up, brought me to Paris, and left me. A third one, with whom I have lived for three years,
        succeeded him. He is a Frenchman, but his business called him to London, and he is there now. Let’s go to your
        place.”</p>

      <p class="p6">“But what shall we do there?”</p>

      <p class="p6">“Let’s go. We will warm ourselves and you will take your fill of pleasure.”</p>

      <p class="p6">This was no time for scruples. Lest she run away when faced with the arguments I had prepared for
        her,
        I led her on by feigning a gallantry which I intended to prove to her I lacked.</p>

        [Conversation, 1816] I never saw a passion like that of Berthier for Mme Visconti. In Egypt, he would watch the
        moon at the same hour that she was supposed to look at it herself. In the middle of the desert, he put up a tent
        for her cult: he put Mme Visconti’s portrait inside it and burned incense there. Three mules were used to
        transport this tent and his baggage. Often I would enter and lie down on the sofa with my boots on. It made
        Berthier furious; he thought it was a profanation of the sanctuary. He loved her so much that he provoked me
        into
        talking about her, although I always spoke ill of her. He didn’t care, he was delighted if one talked about her
        at
        all. He even wanted to leave the army to go back to her. I had my dispatches all ready, received his parting
        wishes, assigned him a dispatch boat, when he came back to me with tears in his eyes. If I had left him in
        command
        in Egypt, he would have evacuated it right away. After the battle of Marengo he made out a report in which
        Soprani
        was cited five times. Soprani was Mme Visconti’s son, a brat of sixteen, and Berthier gave him credit for the
        victory! “Soprani did this, Soprani did that,” he wrote, and all this to please Mme Visconti. In Italy I once
        gave
        him a diamond worth a hundred thousand francs; right away he sent it to Mme Visconti. Two months after his
        marriage with the princess of Bavaria&mdash;which was arranged by Monsieur Visconti&mdash;he came to see me.
        “He’s
        dead,” he said.&mdash;”‘Well, who?&mdash;Her husband!&mdash;”I’m asking you, who?”&mdash;”Monsieur Visconti! I
        have missed my chance of happiness! Why did I get married!” And more nonsense of that sort.</p>

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-972"></a><a id="calibre_link-76"></a>ON WOMEN</h2>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-360"></a><a href="#calibre_link-734"><span class="t16">{23}</span></a> [Letter,
        Paris, 1795] The women are everywhere&mdash;plays, public walks, libraries. You can see very pretty women in the
        scholar’s study room. Only here, of all places on earth, do women deserve to wield such influence, and indeed
        the
        men are mad about them, think of nothing else, and live only through and for them. A woman, in order to know
        what
        is due her and what power she has, must live in Paris for six months.</p>

      <p class="p6">When Napoleon became First Consul, he sought to change this state of affairs. His hatred of
        intellectual and independent women found its ideal mark in Mme de Staël, the most celebrated woman of his time.
        His favorite method of deflating a woman’s superiority was studied brusqueness. A fine sample of his technique
        is
        shown in the following anecdote.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-361"></a><a href="#calibre_link-735"><span class="t16">{24}</span></a> [At a
        reception, c. 1800] Followed by his brother Lucien, Bonaparte stopped in front of Mme de Staël, scrutinized her
        décolleté, and said brusquely, “No doubt you have nursed your children yourself?” Mme de Staël was struck dumb,
        petrified. Here was a question she had not anticipated. As for Bonaparte, he walked on, saying to Lucien, “You
        see? She doesn’t even want to say yes or no.”</p>

      <p class="p6">The following conversation took place during a dinner party at Talleyrand’s house in 1799.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Mme de Staël:</span> What woman, dead or alive, do you consider to be the
        greatest?
      </p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817] Women receive too much consideration in France. They should not be regarded as
        the equals of men; they are, in fact, mere machines to make children.</p>

        [Conversation, c.1803, about Mme de Staël’s novel <span class="t14">Delphine,</span> which poses the problem of
        equality between the sexes] I don’t like masculine women any more than effeminate men. Everybody should play his
        own part in this world. What’s the meaning of all this gypsying of the imagination? What remains of it? Nothing.
        All this is sentimental metaphysics, intellectual disorder.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Anecdote related by Mme de Staël] One day I saw him approach a Frenchwoman who was celebrated for
        her
        beauty, wit, and liveliness of opinion. He placed himself directly facing her, like the stiffest of German
        generals, and said, “Madam, I don’t like women to mix in politics.” “You are right, general,” she replied, “but
        in
        a country where women have their heads cut off, it is only natural that they should like to know why.” Bonaparte
        answered nothing. He is a man whom true resistance appeases. Those who have borne his despotism are equally as
        guilty as he.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817] I also repent not having talked more with the ladies. I would have learned a
        great many things from them that men did not dare tell me. Women, as a matter of fact, have an independence all
        their own.</p>

        that I hate scheming women worse than anything. I am used to women who are good, gentle, and conciliating; they
        are the ones I like. If I have been spoiled, it is not my fault but yours.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817, related by Gourgaud] His Majesty went to bed and declared that he preferred

          href="#calibre_link-738"><span class="t16">{27}</span></a> indeed, after I had received her visits once or

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817] In Vienna, in 1805, Murat said to me, “I want you to meet a charming woman who
        is
        mad about you and wants nothing but you.” Although I had my misgivings, I told him to bring her along. She
        didn’t
        speak a word of French, and I not a word of German. I liked her so much that I spent the whole night with her.
        She
        was one of the most agreeable women I’ve ever met&mdash;no smell. In the morning, she waked me up, and I have
        never seen her since. I never knew who she was.</p>

        [Conversation, 1815] Nothing is more imperious, my dear Las Cases, than weakness when it knows itself backed by
        strength: look at women.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817, reported in English] Women, when they are bad, are worse than men, and more
        ready
        to commit crimes. The soft sex, when degraded, falls lower than the other. Women are always much better or much
        worse than men.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817] One sex must submit to the other. Women have been known to go to war like
        soldiers, and then they are brave, susceptible of great excitement, and capable of committing the worst
        atrocities....If war broke out between men and women, it would be quite a different business from the struggles
        we
        have seen between nobles and the people, or whites and blacks.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817] I can more easily conceive of incest between father and daughter than between
        son
        and mother. In the one case, it is the man who commands; in the other, he must obey his mother.</p>

      <p class="p6">One day, when Mme de Staël accused him of not liking women, Napoleon replied drily, “I like my
        wife.”
        And, when all is said and done, there can be little doubt that his attachment to Josephine was the closest he
        ever

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-369"></a><a href="#calibre_link-743"><span class="t16">{32}</span></a> [Note on
        the state school for girls at Ecouen, 1807] What should be taught the young ladies who will be brought up at
        Ecouen? First of all, religion in all its severity. In this respect you must be uncompromising. Religion is an
        important business in a public institution for young ladies. It is, no matter what has been said, the strongest
        safeguard for mothers and husbands. You must form believers, not reasoners. The weakness of women’s brains, the
        mobility of their ideas, their destination in the social order, the necessity of constant and perpetual
        resignation and of a kind of indulgent and facile charitableness&mdash;all this can be obtained [<span
          class="t14">sic!</span>] only through religion, a charitable and gentle religion....</p>

      <p class="p6">Second, the pupils must be taught arithmetic, writing, and the rudiments of their language, so that
        they learn to spell correctly. They should be taught a little geography and history, but absolutely no Latin or
        foreign languages. The oldest ones may be taught a little botany and may be given a superficial course of
        physics
        or natural history, and at that there may be disadvantageous results. In physics, the teachers should limit
        themselves to the minimum needed to prevent gross ignorance and stupid superstition, and keep strictly to facts,
        without reasonings that bear directly or indirectly on first causes.</p>

      <p class="p6">You will study the question whether it is convenient to give those who have reached a certain grade
        an
        allowance for their clothes. They might get used to economy, calculate the value of things, and make their own
        budgets.</p>

      <p class="p6">In general, however, they should be kept busy, for three quarters of the year, at manual tasks. They
        should know how to knit stockings, make shirts, embroider, in a word, all sorts of feminine handiwork....</p>

      <p class="p6">I do not know if there is a possibility of teaching them a little medicine and pharmacy&mdash;at
        least, the kind of medicine a sick-nurse ought to know. It would also be good if they had some acquaintance with
        that part of the kitchen that is called the pantry. I should like a young girl, when she leaves Ecouen to take
        her
        place at the head of a small household, to be able to make her own dresses, to mend her husband’s clothes, to
        make
        her children’s layettes...to nurse her husband and children when they are ill....</p>

      <p class="p6">I dare not prescribe, as I did at Fontainebleau [a military school for boys], that the pupils
        should-learn cookery. I would have too many people against me. But the girls could be told to prepare their own
        desserts and whatever else may be given them either for their afternoon snack or their holidays. I dispense them
        from cooking, but not from making their own bread. The advantage of this is that they acquire practice in
        everything they may be called upon to do and that their time is naturally employed in practical and useful
        things.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">Their rooms should be furnished by the work of their own hands. They should make their own
        underclothes, stockings, dresses, caps. All this is extremely important, in my opinion. I want these young girls
        to turn into useful women, convinced as I am that thus they will be agreeable women. I do not want to try to
        make
        agreeable women out of them, because they would merely turn into coquettes. Women who make their own dresses
        know
        how to dress tastefully.</p>

      <p class="p6">Dancing is necessary to the health of the pupils, but it should be a jolly sort of dancing and none
        of
        your opera ballets. I shall also grant them music lessons, but vocal music only.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">In this matter it is necessary to stop only short of ridicule. I am bringing up neither fashion

        headmaster’s wife must not receive men except in the parlor. If, in the case of grave illness, it becomes

        boys, who may be called upon to speak in public and who, being obliged to learn many things, need the support
        and
        stimulus of competition. But as for young girls, there must be no competition among them. Their passions must
        not
        be awakened, nor must vanity, the most active passion of the sex, be aroused. Mild punishments, and praise from
        the headmistress for those who conduct themselves well, seem sufficient to me. But grading them by means of
        ribbons does not seem to me to produce desirable results if it has any other objective than to distinguish age

      <p class="p6">The remarks below were made by the First Consul during the discussions of the Civil Code by the
        Conseil d'état in 1802-3.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-370"></a><a href="#calibre_link-744"><span class="t16">{33}</span></a> Marriage
        should be forbidden to individuals who have known each other for less than six months.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Portalis:...</span>Man is sociable, and marriage is ordered by nature.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">The First Consul:</span> I deny that! Marriage is not derived from nature but from
        society and its mores. The Oriental family is altogether different from the Occidental one. The former comprises
        several wives and concubines; this seems immoral, but it works. The laws have provided for it. I do not adopt
        the
        opinion that the family is derived from civil law, and civil law from natural law. The Romans had different
        ideas
        on the family; its organization is based on the mores.</p>

      <p class="p6">The official performing a civil marriage requires a formula containing the promise of obedience and
        fidelity on the part of the wife. She must be made to realize that on leaving the tutelage of her family she
        passes under that of her husband. The civil official performs the marriage without any solemnity&mdash;that is
        too
        colorless. Something more is needed. Look at the priests: they had a sermon. Even if the newlyweds didn’t
        listen,
        being occupied by other thoughts, the congregation did.</p>

      <p class="p6">Is it true that the indissolubility of marriage is absolute?</p>

      <p class="p6">Marriage is indissoluble in the sense that, once it has been contracted, both parties must have the
        firm intention never to terminate it, and they must not at that point foresee the accidental and sometimes
        criminal causes that later may necessitate its dissolution. But the idea that the indissolubility of marriage
        can
        in no case be subject to exceptions is a belief that has been belied by the maxims and practices of every
        century.
        It is contrary to the natural order that two beings, two separate organisms, should ever form a perfect
        identity.
        Now, the legislator must foresee the results that the nature of things may bring to pass. Thus the fiction of
        the
        identity of husband and wife has always been qualified&mdash;by the Catholic Church in case of impotence, and
        everywhere by divorce.</p>

        position of the wife, the dependence of the husband, and preserves intimacy and morality. Somehow a couple does

        often
        likely to dissipate the common patrimony, break up the family, and result in desertion of the children. To allow
        such ties to subsist is an offense against the sanctity of marriage.</p>

        their temperaments are incompatible, than to reduce them to the alternative of either living together or
        separating in open scandal [i.e., in a public trial for adultery]. Nothing is more contrary to the family spirit

        [Conversation, 1816] Man, thrown into life, asks himself, “Whence do I come? Who am I? Where am I going?” Such
        are
        the mysterious questions that impel us toward religion. We rush toward it, we are naturally inclined to
        it&mdash;but then comes information and stops us. Information and history, these are the great enemies of true
        religion, disfigured as it is by human imperfection. We ask ourselves, Why is not the religion of Paris the same
        as that of London or Berlin? Why is it different in Petersburg and in Constantinople? Why does that of
        Constantinople differ from those of Persia, Hindustan, and China? Why ancient religion from modern? Then reason
        contracts in pain and cries out: “Religions, religions! O children born of man!” One believes in God because
        everything around us proclaims him, because the greatest minds believed in him&mdash;not only Bossuet, for after
        all this was his job, but even Newton, Leibniz, who had no business believing. But one doesn’t know what to make
        of the doctrine such as it is taught us, and we end up with the conclusion that we are the watch that goes
        without
        knowing the watchmaker....[As a child] I felt the need to believe, and I believed. But as soon as I began to
        know,
        to reason, my faith was jarred and uncertain. And this happened to me when I was no older than thirteen. Perhaps
        one day I shall regain blind faith&mdash;please God I may! I certainly don’t resist faith, I demand nothing
        better. I imagine that it must give a great and true happiness.</p>

      <p class="p6">However, I affirm that in the great storms, even when I accidentally produced the impression of
        immorality, the absence of religious faith has never influenced me in any way whatever, and I have never doubted
        God. For if my reason did not suffice to understand him, yet my inner feeling accepted him. My nerves were in
        sympathy with that feeling.</p>

        [Manuscript, 1791] There are truths that feeling alone can demonstrate. We shall call them “felt truths.” There
        are truths that pure logic can prove, such as mathematical truths.</p>

      <p class="p6">In the moral sciences, a felt truth, if developed by a natural logic, produces a rational result or
        a
        series of truths that perfect society and legislation and prescribe rules of conduct: thus were born the
        dialogues
        of Plato, the <span class="t14">Social Contract,</span> the <span class="t14">Essay on Human
          Understanding.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="p6">In the moral sciences, a logically demonstrable truth, even if developed by a sound logic, produces
        a
        series of deductions that ordinarily are mere sophistry and error. This explains how, despite its sound logic,
        scholasticism has created theology, that sink of prejudices and errors of all kinds.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Address to the parish priests of Milan, 1800] I too am a philosopher, and I know that no matter
        what
        society a man lives in, he cannot be regarded as virtuous and righteous if he does not know whence he comes and
        where he goes. Mere reason cannot give us certainty on this. Without religion, we walk in continuous darkness,
        and
        the Catholic religion is the only one that gives man certain and infallible knowledge of his origin and ultimate
        purpose. No society can exist without morality; there is no sound morality without religion; thus only religion
        gives the state firm and lasting support.</p>

        [Manuscript, 1786] Always alone in the midst of men, I come to my room to dream by myself, to abandon myself to
        my
        melancholy in all its sharpness. In which direction does it lead today? Toward death. At the dawn of my life I
        may
        still hope to live a long time. For six or seven years I have been away from home [Corsica]. What happiness
        shall
        I taste when in four months I shall see my countrymen and family again! From the tender feelings which the
        memories of childhood make me experience, may I not deduce that my bliss will be complete? What fury drives me
        to
        desire my own destruction? Indeed, what am I to do in this world? Since die I must, is it not just as well to
        kill
        myself? If I had already passed my sixtieth year, I would respect the prejudice of my contemporaries and would
        wait patiently for nature to take its course. But since my misfortunes are beginning, since nothing is pleasure
        to
        me, why should I bear days that nothing turns to profit? How far men have got away from nature! How cowardly
        they
        are, how vile and rampant! What shall I find in my country? My compatriots charged with chains, trembling as
        they
        kiss the hand of their oppressor!...</p>

      <p class="p6">When the fatherland is no more, the patriot must die. If in order to free my countrymen all I had to
        do was destroy one man, I should set out this instant and plunge into the tyrant’s breast the avenging sword of
        fatherland and law. Life is a burden to me because I taste no pleasure and all is pain to me. It is a burden
        because the men with whom I live and probably shall always live have ways as different from mine as the moon
        from
        the sun. Thus I cannot pursue the only way of life that could make life tolerable&mdash;hence distaste for

      <p class="p6">When is life an evil? When it offers a man nothing but suffering and pain. However, since sufferings
        and pain change at every instant, there is not a moment in life when a man has the right to kill himself. The
        moment could not come till the very hour of his death, since only then could it be proved to him that his life
        has
        been nothing but a web of suffering and evil.</p>

      <p class="p6">There is no man who has not wanted to kill himself several times in his life, yielding to the moral
        diseases of his soul, and who, a few days later, would not have regretted it because of changes that have

        Saturday, and yet one kills oneself only once.</p>

        life is only a present evil, he sacrifices the future. The evils of the day do not give him the right to
        sacrifice
        his future life. The man whose life is an evil and who possesses the certainty (which is impossible) that it
        must
        remain so forever, whose position and will can be altered neither by changes in circumstances and situation nor
        by
        habit and the passage of time (another impossibility)&mdash;that man alone would have the right to kill himself.

      <p class="p6">The analogy of the gangrenous arm that is amputated to save the body does not apply. When the
        surgeon
        cuts off the arm, he is certain that that limb would bring death to the body: this is not a feeling but a fact.
        Whereas, when the sufferings of life drive a man to suicide, he not only makes an end of them but destroys the
        future as well. A man will never repent having had his arm amputated, but he may and almost always does repent
        his

        his hopes alive and allowed him to look on the last stages of his dissolution as on a promise of change?</p>

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-983"></a><a id="calibre_link-87"></a>THE PURPOSE OF LIFE</h2>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-392"></a><a href="#calibre_link-266"><span class="t16">{55}</span></a>
        [Manuscript, before 1793] We are born for the enjoyment of life. Happiness is merely the enjoyment of life in
        the
        manner that conforms best to our nature. We are born, then, to be happy.</p>

      <p class="p6">We continuously experience agreeable or disagreeable sensations. No one can deny that nature shies
        from the latter and inclines us to avoid them just as she causes us to seek help from a physician to recover our
        health. We experience these sensations in all conditions of life, the laborer like the prince, but under varying
        forms.</p>

      <p class="p6">In what does this enjoyment of life consist? We must go down into our hearts and read there.</p>

      <p class="p6">We perceive in animals no other occupation than getting food. Yet they appear to be susceptible to
        passions: the dog, of love; the cow, of compassion; the elephant, of gratitude; and so forth. But only extremely
        long habit seems to make them susceptible of all these various attributes of the soul. It would be difficult,
        then, to deny them an instinct similar to ours, though on a much lesser scale. Since this instinct is not nearly
        enough developed to admit of ideas, they merely have images which, though quite adequate in warning them of
        danger
        and insuring their conservation, are not derived from any sort of imagination. Animals lack the restlessness
        that
        comes from imagination and consequently are incapable of perfectibility, which requires the ability to compare
        images or ideas, an ability which we have said they do not possess.</p>

      <p class="p6">For example, a small child believes he can grasp an object at the opposite end of a table. He
        discovers that he cannot. Another time, he will approach the object. A horse wants to pass from one meadow into
        the next. He walks straight ahead, comes to an obstructing wall, and follows it until he finds an opening. Yet
        this is an acquired perfection. Birds build their nests exactly as they did a thousand years ago, and so do
        bees.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">Man has moral as well as physical needs. To eat is the first law of all creatures. Man is
        exceptional
        in that he spends far less time in eating, and it would seem that this activity&mdash;to ruminate and to
        sleep&mdash;is the proper occupation of beasts. But which is man’s? The chain of events brings him pleasures and
        pains, caused by his passions, without which he would experience neither pain nor pleasure and be the unhappiest
        of created beings. But what do I say? He would no longer be a man! His peculiar ability to compare gives birth,
        by
        producing reflection and imagination, to all the passions by which we see him ever agitated. As a physical
        being,
        man must eat; as a moral being, he must master himself. In what consists this mastery? In guiding his passions,
        his moral faculties, in such a manner as to make each one tend toward his happiness.</p>

      <p class="p6">Physical self-preservation is the first law of nature; the wish for happiness comes next. What is
        happiness? The end to which we are on earth&mdash;that is, the true enjoyment of life. Do men not go astray
        while
        seeking it? Almost always....Each of their several ruling passions dominates them in turn and causes them to
        prostitute the name of happiness to the fulfillment of that passion....They never act in cold blood.</p>

      <p class="p6">Half of the world is ambitious and seeks happiness in honors. Love of glory causes them to desire
        power and danger. Lust, avarice, wealth; love, the possession of a woman; philanthropy, the relief of the poor;
        idleness, study, curiosity, success (often these passions combine in a single person: he is ambitious,
        voluptuous,
        and in love. He no longer calls himself)<a id="calibre_link-393"></a><a href="#calibre_link-267"><span
            class="t16">{56}</span></a> happy except in the approximate sense in which a man dying of thirst calls it
        happiness to drink water. Thus the acute desire to attain happiness is one of the principal causes of the
        powerful
        hold a passion has on us.</p>

      <p class="p6">When on rising from sleep a man does not know what to do with himself and drags his tedious
        existence
        from place to place; when, scanning the future, he sees nothing but dreadful monotony, one day resembling the
        next; when he asks himself, “Why do I exist?”&mdash;then, in my opinion, he is the most wretched of all. His
        machine breaks down, his heart loses the energy that is proper to man. How can this empty heart manage to exist?
        To live thus is to lead the life of beasts with the moral faculties peculiar to our nature. Happy he if he did
        not
        possess these faculties! And so this man is discouraged by every trifle. The least defeat seems to him an
        unbearable calamity. It is a quiet life, but where are its rewards? The scholar seems to be in the same
        position.
        He studies, he argues, his reason will be satisfied, but has he no heart? Where will this heap of varied
        knowledge
        lead him? Will not the emptiness of his solitude, will not an inner emotion tell him, “No! I am not happy”?</p>

      <p class="p6">[Letter, 1807] All my life I have sacrificed everything&mdash;comfort, self-interest,
        happiness&mdash;to my destiny.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1815, aboard the <span class="t14">Bellerophon</span>] Destiny must be

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] <span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Is it true that they picture me as a

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Las Cases:</span> Why yes, Sire, at least many people do.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Well now, well now&mdash;Let them talk. At that, they may want to
        imitate me, and that may at times have its useful points. Men are strange, though! It is easier to impress them
        and strike their imagination with tomfooleries than with sound ideas. But how can a sensible person be deceived
        for a moment? Either fatalism is compatible with free will or it excludes it. If it is compatible, how can an
        effect be determined in advance, as they say, and yet be modified <span class="t14">ad infinitum</span> by the
        slightest whim, a single step, a single word? If, on the contrary, fatalism excludes free will, it’s a different
        matter. Then, when you come into the world, all that has to be done is throw you into your cradle, without
        taking
        the least care. If it is irrevocably preordained that you shall live, even if you get nothing to eat or drink,
        you
        will grow up anyhow. You can easily see that this doctrine is indefensible, it’s just a word. Even the Turks,
        those champions of fatalism, are far from convinced by it. Otherwise they would have no physicians, and people
        living on the third floor would not trouble to waste time walking downstairs, but come down directly through the
        window.</p>

        [Dictation,
        Saint Helena, on the coup d’état of 18 Brumaire] When a deplorable weakness and ceaseless vacillations become
        manifest in supreme councils; when, yielding in turn to the influences of opposing parties, making shift from
        day
        to day, and marching with uncertain pace, a government has proved the full measure of its impotence; when even
        the
        most moderate citizens are forced to admit that the State is no longer governed; when, in fine, the
        administration
        adds to its nullity at home the gravest guilt it can acquire in the eyes of a proud nation&mdash;I mean its
        humiliation abroad&mdash;then a vague unrest spreads through the social body, the instinct of self-preservation
        is
        stirred, and the nation casts a sweeping eye over itself, as if to seek a man who can save it.</p>

      <p class="p6">This guardian angel a great nation harbors in its bosom at all times; yet sometimes he is late in
        making his appearance. Indeed, it is not enough for him to exist: he also must be known. He must know himself.
        Until then, all endeavors are in vain, all schemes collapse. The inertia of the masses protects the nominal
        government, and despite its ineptitude and weakness the efforts of its enemies fail. But let that impatiently
        awaited savior give a sudden sign of his existence, and the people’s instinct will divine him and call upon him.
        The obstacles are smoothed before his steps, and a whole great nation, flying to see him pass, will seem to be
        saying: “Here is the man!”</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816, reported in English] Your nation [the British] called Washington a leader of

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] A consecutive series of great actions never is the result of chance and luck;

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] I had few really definite ideas, and the reason for this was that, instead of
        obstinately seeking to control circumstances, I obeyed them, and they forced me to change my mind all the time.

      <p class="p6">After the destruction of the French fleet in Aboukir Bay by Nelson in 1798, Bourrienne, Bonaparte’s

        me,
        I’ll dictate.</p>

      <p class="p6">[From Napoleon’s own report to the Directory, Cairo, August 19, 1798] No matter how great the
        reverse,
        it cannot be attributed to the inconstancy of Fortune. She has not yet abandoned us: far from it, she has served
        us better in this operation than ever before.</p>

      <p class="p6">When I sighted Alexandria and was informed that the English fleet had been there, with superior
        forces, several days earlier, I ordered a landing despite the frightful storm that was blowing and at the risk
        of
        shipwreck. I recall that at the instant when we were getting ready to disembark, a man of war was sighted in the
        distance, sailing before the wind. I exclaimed, “Fortune, hast thou abandoned me? Five days is all I ask of
        thee!”
        The ship turned out to be the <span class="t14">Justice</span> [a French ship] coming from Malta.</p>

      <p class="p6">We marched all night. I attacked Alexandria at daybreak, with three thousand worn-out men, without
        artillery, almost without cartridges, and within five days I was master of Rosetta and Damanhur, that is to say,
        firmly established in Egypt. In these five days, the fleet should have found shelter from the British, no matter
        what their strength; but, far from it, it remained exposed throughout the month of Messidor. Early in Thermidor
        it
        received two months’ rice supplies from Rosetta. For ten days the English showed themselves in superior numbers
        in
        these waters. On 11 Thermidor, our fleet received news of our complete mastery over Egypt and our entry into
        Cairo. Only then, when Fortune realized the uselessness of all her favors, did she abandon our fleet to its
        fate.

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, near Maloyaroslavets, October 23, 1812, related by Ségur] The Emperor shortly before
        had sent Marshal Bessières to reconnoiter the disposition of the enemy. Bessières obeyed and carefully surveyed
        the Russian front position. “It is unassailable,” he reported. “O Heavens!” the Emperor cried out, joining his
        hands. “Are you sure? Is it really true? Can you answer for it?” Bessières repeated his assertion, affirming
        that
        “three hundred grenadiers in that position would be enough to stop a whole army.” Then Napoleon was seen to
        cross
        his arms with an air of consternation, lower his head, and stand motionless as if sunk in the most melancholy
        reflections. His army, he said, was victorious, and he defeated! His route cut off, his maneuver frustrated!
        Kutuzov, a dotard, a barbarian, had outmaneuvered him! And he could not even blame his star. Had not the sun of
        France followed him into Russia? [That autumn of 1812 was unusually and deceptively mild.] Only yesterday the
        Maloyaroslavets road had been open. It was not his luck, then, that had failed him. Was it he who had failed his

        [Manuscript, early 1790s] But ambition, that immoderate desire to satisfy vanity or intemperance, which, never
        sated, leads Alexander from Thebes to Persia, from the Granicus to Issus, from Issus to Arbela, from Arbela to
        India&mdash;ambition causes him to conquer and ravage the world and yet fails to appease him. The same ardor
        still
        consumes him, and in his delirium he no longer knows what course he should give it. In his agitation he goes
        astray....Alexander believes himself a god, he thinks himself the son of Jupiter, and he wants to make others
        believe it....</p>

      <p class="p6">Ambition, which overthrows governments and private fortunes, which feeds on blood and crimes,
        ambition...is, like all inordinate passions, a violent and unthinking fever that ceases only when life

        flatterers, as may be supposed, place him in the first rank. Now, what more can he covet?...The same madness
        that
        alienated Alexander’s brain, produced by the same cause, takes hold of Richelieu....He wants to be believed a

        [Manuscript,
        1788] There are two roads by which nations can rise to great power.</p>

      <p class="p6">A maximum of equality, frugality, wisdom, great courage, stable institutions, vigorously applied
        principles, and, above all, a great contempt for riches: Rome, Sparta, Crotona, Persia succeeded by that road.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">A flourishing commerce intelligently fostered and encouraged by a large degree of freedom gives
        birth
        to a good fleet, increases the population, enriches the citizens, fills the public treasury, and furnishes
        inexhaustible resources. In that case, policy must aim chiefly at stimulating continuous activity in the
        circulation [of goods and currency]. Art, science, and monuments seem to be particularly suited to this form of
        government, although they played no part at the beginning: Tyre, Carthage, Athens, Sybaris, Syracuse, etc.,
        etc.,
        etc.</p>

      <p class="p6">Experience nearly always proves that, when nations of the latter category are in conflict with those
        of the first, they are almost invariably defeated because war destroys their commerce and gradually exhausts
        them,
        while the others are toughened and strengthened and are, so to speak, in their own element&mdash;provided,
        however, that the war is not carried into their own territory, which is their only resource for the sustenance
        of
        life.</p>

        [Dictation,
        1816] The area of Italy contained within the [Alpine] semicircle is 5,000 square leagues. From the diameter of
        that semicircle, Italy extends in the shape of a boot which, being 200 leagues in length, contains, from Parma
        to
        the Gulf of Taranto, 8,000 square leagues. Sicily and Sardinia: 2,000 square leagues. Total: 15,000 square
        leagues. Thus, about two thirds of Italy extends along that line of prolongation and is surrounded by the
        Mediterranean and Adriatic seas.</p>

      <p class="p6">This singular configuration has beyond any doubt influenced the destiny of that lovely country. If
        the
        peninsula, instead of being 40 to 50 leagues, had been 90 to 100 leagues wide, and only half its actual length,
        its center would have been closer to its whole periphery; there would have been a greater community of
        interests.
        The nation, spread over lesser distances, would have been more uniform and would have fought off with better
        success the designs to break it up; and the cohesive tendency that has united France, England, and Spain would
        have acted upon Italy as well.</p>

      <p class="p6">It is interesting to compare this analysis with another passage, dictated at the same period, in
        which
        Napoleon echoes Machiavelli <span class="t14">(Discourses</span> I. xii). The italicized words are virtually
        copied from the Florentine.</p>

      <p class="p6">Without the politics of the popes, the public spirit of the Italians&mdash;an enlightened and
        passionate nation&mdash;would have surmounted these local obstacles. <span class="t14">But the Vatican, too weak
          to unite all Italy under its domination, was at all times powerful enough to prevent any one republic or
          prince
          from unifying it under his authority.</span> Three things were opposed to that great design: (1) the
        possessions
        held by foreign powers [in Italy]; (2) the local spirit; (3) the residence of the popes in Rome.</p>

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-996"></a><a id="calibre_link-99"></a>THE RISE OF MONOTHEISM</h2>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-416"></a><a href="#calibre_link-35"><span class="t16">{79}</span></a>
        [Dictation,
        c. 1817] Moses revealed God’s existence to his nation; Jesus Christ, to the Roman Empire; Mohammed, to the
        ancient
        continent. Moses freed the descendants of Jacob from the Egyptian captivity. He retained them in the desert for
        forty years and there gave them laws. They never ceased yearning after those “fleshpots from which they had
        eaten
        to the full.” In order to combat their nostalgic spirit he labored to inspire them with an exclusive character
        and
        to isolate them amid all other nations. The Hebrews knew the true God a thousand years before other men.</p>

      <p class="p6">Jesus Christ, although descended from David, laid no claim to the throne of his fathers. He obeyed,
        and commanded obedience to, any established government. “All power comes from God. My kingdom is not of this
        world. Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s.” In his divine mission he had only one aim: to regulate
        men’s consciences, to guide souls in this life that they might achieve happiness in the next. The Gospels
        prescribe no rule whatever for the government of earthly things. Christian doctrine contained nothing that could
        have incited the jealousy of the Cæsars; on the other hand, for the same reason, it was extremely favorable to
        the
        dynasties that rose from the rubble of the Roman Empire: it legitimatized them. Clovis was not truly king before
        his consecration.</p>

      <p class="p6">The Christian religion is that of a highly civilized people. It heightens man’s stature. It
        proclaims
        the superiority of spirit over matter, of the soul over the body. It was born in the schools of Greece. It was
        the
        triumph of men such as Socrates, Plato, Aristides, over the Flaminiuses, the Scipios, the Paulluses. The Romans
        conquered Greece by the strength of their arms but they were insensibly subjugated by the irresistible influence
        of the spirit, the arts, and the sciences of the vanquished. The basic canons of the Church were discussed and
        decreed in the councils held in the East during the first eight centuries, at Nicaea, Alexandria, Antioch,
        Constantinople, Chalcedon, Caesarea, and Athens. Like everything established by the sole strength of persuasion,
        like everything resulting from the progress of the mind, the religion of Christ progressed slowly. It required
        four centuries to take its seat on the throne. The apotheosis of Caesar and of Augustus had been followed by
        those
        of the most abject tyrants. The masses contracted a violent hatred for a religion that gave altars and priests
        to
        a Tiberius, a Caligula, a Heliogabalus. They found consolation in the dogma of an only God, immortal, uncreated,
        creator, judge and master of all.</p>

      <p class="p6">The Christian Church promised to the righteous the reward of seeing God face to face, an entirely
        spiritual bliss, at the same time that it threatened the damned with entirely material punishments, since they
        were to burn in flaming furnaces. This contrast may be explained. If the wicked had been threatened with merely
        spiritual punishments, they would have defied them; the bridle would have been too weak to repress their evil
        tendencies. On the other hand, a Paradise in which the chosen tasted earthly pleasures would have exalted the
        flesh, and Christian morality aims primarily at repressing and mortifying it. Thus imperfect contrition is, like
        perfect contrition, a means of salvation.</p>

      <p class="p6">Arabia was idolatrous when, seven centuries after Christ, Mohammed introduced the cult of the God of
        Abraham, Ishmael, Moses, and Jesus. The Arians and other sects that had troubled the peace of the East had
        stirred
        up the problems of the nature of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Mohammed declared there was but
        one
        God who had neither father nor son and that the Trinity carried a germ of idolatry. He wrote on the frontispiece
        of the Koran: “There is no god but God.” The nations to which he addressed himself were savage and poor. They
        lacked everything and were extremely ignorant. If he had spoken to their minds, he would not have been heard. In
        the midst of the abundance of Greece, the pleasures of spiritual contemplation had been a need. But in the
        middle
        of the desert, where the Bedouin longed constantly for a spring, for the shade of a palm tree to shelter him
        from
        the burning rays of the tropical sun, it was necessary to promise other rewards to the chosen&mdash;ever-flowing
        rivers of milk and fragrant groves under whose eternal shade they might rest in the arms of divine white-skinned
        and dark-eyed maidens. The Bedouins contracted a passion for so enchanting a dwelling place. They braved
        everything to arrive there: they became heroes.</p>

      <p class="p6">Mohammed was a ruler. He rallied his countrymen around him. Within a few years his Moslems conquered
        half the world. They tore more souls away from the false gods, they overthrew more idols, they demolished more
        pagan temples in fifteen years than the followers of Moses and Christ had done in fifteen centuries. Mohammed
        was
        a great man. He would in effect have become a god if the revolution which he precipitated had not been prepared
        by
        circumstances. When he appeared on the scene the Arabs had, for many years, been toughened by civil wars.
        Whatever
        great things nations have accomplished on the stage of the world they have done at times when they were emerging
        from the kind of crisis that tempers body and soul anew. If the Arabs had lost the battles of al-Qadisiah and
        [blank in manuscript], which made it possible for the intrepid Moslems to raise the standard of the Prophet on
        the
        Oxus and on the confines of China; if they had lost at Ajnadayn and at Yarmuk, which placed Syria and Egypt
        under
        their sway; if such leaders as Khalid, Derar, or Amr had been routed and thrown back into their immense
        deserts&mdash;the Arabs would have resumed their nomadic life, they would have gone on living like their
        fathers,
        in wretched poverty. The names of Mohammed, Ali, and Omar would be unknown to the world.</p>

      <p class="p6">The progressive rise of Christianity, on the contrary, did not depend on the outcome of any
        secondary
        event. That religion spread and insinuated itself like a doctrine which captivates and persuades and whose march
        cannot be stopped by anything. Constantine hastened its triumph&mdash;but if he had not asked to be baptized,
        one
        of his successors would have done so sooner or later. Jesus Christ was a preacher; he gave his apostles the gift
        of tongues. Moses and Mohammed were national leaders who gave laws and ruled the affairs of this world. “The
        sword
        is the key to Heaven,” says the Prophet. “Whosoever perishes in battle is absolved of his sins. The wings of
        angels shall replace the limbs that have been lost in battle; the censer and the sword are one.” He was
        intolerant
        and exclusive. To kill the infidels or to force them to pay tribute, to destroy the power of idolatry because it
        is an outrage to God&mdash;this is enjoined on every page of the Koran. Never did the Moslems sincerely submit
        to
        the authority of any idolatrous prince.</p>

      <p class="p6">The three religions that have spread the knowledge of an immortal God, uncreated, master and creator
        of man, all originated in Arabia. Moses, Christ, Mohammed were Arabs, born in Memphis, in Nazareth [sic], in
        Mecca. Europe, Asia, Africa, America, with all their immense deserts, their mighty mountains, their vast seas,
        their fertile plains, their huge cities, are invoking Moses, Christ, or Mohammed, take their laws from the
        Pentateuch, the Gospels, or the Koran, and turn their eyes toward Arabia, Jerusalem, Nazareth, or Mecca. If Rome
        is the capital of Christendom, it is because the Scipios, the Cæsars, the Trajans had conquered a portion of the
        world. The influence of the New Rome is a result of the power of the old. But why do Jerusalem, Nazareth, and
        Mecca all belong to the same country?</p>

      <p class="p6">“In former times only one kind of property was known&mdash;landed property. A new kind has made its

        third
        kind: the property derived from huge revenues raised by the administration. These revenues, distributed by the
        impersonal and disinterested hands of the government, may protect the two others from monopoly, act as their
        intermediary, and prevent them from fighting each other.” He called this great struggle of our days the war
        between the fields and the counting-houses, between the castles and the factories.</p>

      <p class="p6">“And yet,” said he, “it is because we have refused to take notice of this great revolution, because
        we
        have obstinately shut our eyes to these truths that so many follies are committed in our days and that we risk
        so
        many violent upheavals. The world has experienced a great shift, and it seeks to settle in a new position. Here,

        [Conversation, 1816] Alexander had barely outgrown his boyhood when with a handful of men he conquered a portion
        of the globe: but was this, on his part, a mere irruption, a kind of deluge? No&mdash;everything was calculated
        deeply, carried out audaciously, and managed wisely. Alexander proved himself at once a great warrior, a great
        statesman, a great lawgiver. Unfortunately, upon attaining the zenith of his glory and success, his head was
        turned, or his heart corrupted. He had started out with the soul of Trajan; he ended up with the heart of Nero
        and
        the morals of Heliogabalus.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1818] What I like in Alexander the Great is not his campaigns, which we cannot

        was
        right in ordering the murder of Parmenion, who like a fool had objected to Alexander’s abandonment of Greek

        the authority over their cities. He refused to realize that Caesar’s authority was legitimate because it was a

        the
        result of the popular opinion and will....Caesar did not want to be king because he could not want it. He could
        not want it because, after him, for six hundred years, none of his successors wanted it. It would have been
        strange politics to substitute for the curule chair of the world’s conquerors the rotten and despised throne of

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-1002"></a><a id="calibre_link-105"></a>ON TEACHING HISTORY</h2>

      <p class="p6">Napoleon in 1807 dictated the following observations concerning a project for establishing a special
        school for literature and history in the Collège de France.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-427"></a><a href="#calibre_link-46"><span class="t16">{90}</span></a> It is
        possible to relate history to those sciences which could be taught to good advantage in a specialized school.
        The
        way history should be read is, in itself, a real science. Everything has been said and said over again.
        Apocryphal
        historians have multiplied, and there is so great a difference between a history written at one period and
        another
        history written at a later period with the help of the researches and insights of the earlier historians that a
        man who seeks solid information and who is suddenly put into a large historical library would feel caught in a
        veritable maze.</p>

      <p class="p6">To know what remains extant of the ancient historians, what has been lost, how to distinguish
        original
        fragments from supplements written by good or bad commentators&mdash;these things alone almost constitute a
        science, or at least the object of important studies. Thus acquaintance with and the choice of good historians,
        reliable memoirs, or true contemporary chronicles form a useful and real branch of knowledge. If in a great
        capital like Paris there were a specialized school of history, beginning with a course in bibliography, a young
        man instead of wasting months getting lost in inadequate or unreliable literature would be guided toward the
        best
        works and would acquire sounder knowledge by an easier and shorter road.</p>

      <p class="p6">There is, moreover, one section of history that cannot be learned in books&mdash;that of the most
        recent times. No historian ever reaches our times. For a young man of twenty-five, there always is the gap of
        the
        fifty years preceding his birth, on which there is no history. This gap creates many difficulties: linking the
        events of the past to those of the present requires a great deal of invariably imperfect and sometimes fruitless
        labor. To bridge this gap would be an important task of the professors in the special school of history.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">It is easy to guess at my secret intention, which is to bring together scholars who will continue
        not
        the history of philosophy, not the history of religion, but the history of facts and who will carry that history
        down to our times. It is easier for our young people to learn about the Punic Wars than to know something of the
        American Revolution, which took place in 1783.</p>

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-1003"></a><a id="calibre_link-106"></a>ON WRITING HISTORY</h2>

      <p class="p6">In 1808 the minister of the interior, Count Cretet, refused subsidies to a historian who wanted to
        continue the <span class="t14">Histoire de France</span> by Velly and others. He justified his refusal on the
        ground that it was not up to the government to subsidize such private pursuits. Napoleon reversed the decision
        by
        the following Note, which he himself dictated.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-428"></a><a href="#calibre_link-47"><span class="t16">{91}</span></a> His
        Majesty
        does not approve the principles stated by the minister of the interior in his Note. They were true twenty years
        ago, they will be true again sixty years from now, but they are false today....It is of the utmost importance to
        make sure that the continuation be written in the right spirit. Youth can judge facts only according to the
        manner
        in which they are presented. To deceive it by recalling memories means to lead it into future errors....</p>

      <p class="p6">The writers to whom this project is to be entrusted must possess true talent, to be sure, but they
        also must be loyal men who will present facts in their true light and who will lay the groundwork for a sound
        education by continuing these historians from the point where they had stopped and by bringing the history up to
        the Year VIII [1799-1800].</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">Henry IV, Louis XIII, Louis XIV, Louis XV should be given their due, but without adulation. The
        September Massacres and the horrors of the Revolution must be painted with the same brush as the
        Inquisition....When speaking of the Revolution, care should be taken to avoid any reactionary tendency. No man
        could have prevented it. Neither those who perished nor those who survived should be blamed. There was no
        individual strong enough to change forces or to forestall events that were born from the nature of things and
        circumstances.</p>

      <p class="p6">It is necessary to point out the perpetual disorder of public finances, the chaos of the provincial
        assemblies, the arrogance of the parlements, the irregularity and incompetence of the administration (France was
        a
        conglomeration of twenty kingdoms rather than a unified state), in such a manner that the reader should sigh
        with
        relief when he reaches our own epoch, which lets us enjoy the benefits bestowed upon us by uniform laws,
        government, and local administration. The continual weakness of the government even under Louis XIV, as well as
        under Louis XV and Louis XVI, should foster an urge to strengthen the recently accomplished work....</p>

      <p class="p6">There is no more important task. Political passion and partisanship of every shade can produce
        lengthy
        books in order to lead public opinion astray; but a work such as Velly’s...should have a single continuator.
        Once
        this work is published, if it is written competently and in the correct spirit, no one will have the desire or
        the
        energy to write another&mdash;especially if the police, far from encouraging such an attempt, does everything to
        discourage it. The opinion expressed by the minister in his Note, which, if it were followed, would leave such a
        project to private enterprise and to the speculations of some publisher, is erroneous and could lead to
        regrettable results.</p>

      <p class="p6">As for the individual who presented the request [to write the continuation], the only question to be
        examined is whether he possesses the required talent, whether his opinions are sound, and whether the spirit
        that
        would guide his researches and his pen may be relied upon.</p>

        revolt which success and the passage of time legitimize but in which terror is one of the inevitable phases....
      </p>

      <p class="p6">The French Revolution was a nationwide convulsion as irresistible in its effects as a volcanic
        eruption. When the mysterious molten substance in the entrails of the earth has reached its explosive point, the
        lava escapes and the eruption takes place. The hidden travail of the masses follows an identical course: when
        their sufferings are ripe, they explode in revolution.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">A revolution can be neither made nor stopped. The only thing that can be done is for one or several
        of
        its children to give it a direction by dint of victories [over the anti-revolutionists], or else for its enemies
        to stifle it temporarily by the strength of arms. But in the latter case the revolutionary fire smolders under
        the
        ashes, and sooner or later the conflagration flares up again with new vigor and devours all obstacles.</p>

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-1005"></a><a id="calibre_link-108"></a>THE FRENCH REVOLUTION: A VIEW FOR
        POSTERITY</h2>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-430"></a><a href="#calibre_link-49"><span class="t16">{93}</span></a>
        [Dictation,
        1816] The French Revolution was...a general mass movement of the nation against the privileged classes. The
        French
        nobility, like that of all Europe, dates from the barbarian invasions which broke up the Roman Empire. In
        France,
        the nobles represented the ancient Franks and Burgundians; the rest of the nation, the Gauls. The introduction
        of
        the feudal system established the principle that every landed property had a lord. All political rights were
        exercised by the priests and the nobles. The peasants were enslaved, partly by binding them to the soil.</p>

      <p class="p6">The progress of civilization and knowledge liberated the people. This new state of affairs caused
        the
        prosperity of industry and trade. In the eighteenth century, the larger part of the land, of wealth, and of the
        fruits of civilization belonged to the people. The nobles, however, still formed a privileged class: they
        controlled the upper and intermediate courts, they held feudal rights under a great variety of names and forms,
        they were exempt from contributing to any of the taxes imposed by society, and they had exclusive access to the
        most honorable employments.</p>

      <p class="p6">All these abuses stirred the citizens to protest. The chief aim of the Revolution was to destroy all
        privileges; to abolish manorial courts, justice being an inalienable attribute of the sovereign authority; to
        suppress all feudal rights as remnants of the people’s former slavery; to subject all citizens and all property
        without distinction to taxation by the State. Finally, the Revolution proclaimed the equality of rights. All
        citizens could fill all employments, subject only to their talents and the vicissitudes of chance.</p>

      <p class="p6">The monarchy was made up of provinces annexed to the Crown at various periods....France was not a
        state but an unamalgamated collection of several states placed side by side. Chance and the events of past
        centuries had determined the whole. The Revolution, applying its guiding principle of equality to the citizens
        among themselves as well as to the various territories, destroyed all these petty nations and created a new
        great
        nation. There was no more Brittany, no more Normandy, Burgundy, Champagne, Provence, or Lorraine: there was a
        France....</p>

      <p class="p6">Whatever had been brought about in the sequence of events since the time of Clovis ceased to exist.
        These changes were all so favorable to the people that they took hold with the greatest ease: by 1800 there
        remained not a single memory of the old privileges....In order to trace any existing institution to its origin
        all
        that was necessary was to look up the new law that had established it. Half of the land had changed ownership;
        the
        farmers and the bourgeois had become rich. The progress of agriculture, manufactures, and industry passed all
        our
        hopes. France offered the spectacle of thirty million inhabitants living within natural limits, farming a single
        class of citizens governed by a single law, a single organization, a single order. All these changes accorded
        with
        the well-being of the nation, with its laws, with justice, and with the spirit of the century.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] The counter-revolution [i.e., the reaction that set in after 1815], even if
        given
        a free course, must inevitably come to drown in revolution....For henceforth nothing can destroy or efface the
        grand principles of our Revolution. These great and noble truths must remain forever, so inextricably are they
        linked to our splendor, our monuments, our prodigious deeds. We have drowned its earlier shame in floods of
        glory.
        These truths are henceforth immortal....They live on in England, they illumine America, they are naturalized in
        France: from this tripod the light will burst upon the world.</p>

      <p class="p6">These truths will rule the world. They will be the creed, the religion, the morality of all nations.
        And, no matter what has been said, this memorable era will be linked to my person, because, after all, I have
        carried its torch and consecrated its principles, and because persecution now has made me its Messiah.</p>

      <p class="p6">“Bonaparte made frequent use of the word ideologist,” notes Bourrienne’s ghost writer, who on
        occasion
        puts matters well. “By that he intended to ridicule the men whom he suspected of a tendency toward belief in
        indefinite perfectibility. He esteemed them for their moral integrity, but he regarded them as dreamers who were
        looking for a general constitutional pattern applicable to all nations and who, while laboring for the happiness
        of men, ignored the concrete realities of the human character. According to him, the ideologists held power to
        be
        inherent in institutions; he called this metaphysics. To him, all power rested on material strength”
        (Bourrienne,
        <span class="t14">Mémoires,</span> II, 208).

        [Conversation, 1803] Well, you’re right, it’s true that the metaphysicians are my pet aversion. I have
        classified
        all these people under the head of ideologists, which, by the way, is peculiarly and literally suited to them:
        <span class="t14">idea seekers</span>&mdash;hollow ideas, as a rule. Now, the apt application of the term <span
          class="t14">ideologist</span> to that class has cast even more ridicule on them than I had dared expect. The
        expression stuck&mdash;I think because it came from me. There’s no harm in it. There will be less ideology
        around....All things considered&mdash;and I have given this much thought&mdash;those poor scholars (<span

        govern
        the way they think I ought to? Yes, they have a craze for interfering with my policies! They talk, talk, talk.
        My
        aversion for this breed of ideologists goes to the point of hatred. I don’t care who knows it.

      <p class="p6">[Reply to the Conseil d'état, December 20, 1812] It is to this ideology, this shady metaphysics

        knowledge of human psychology and to historic lessons, that every misfortune experienced by our beautiful France
        must be attributed. These errors were bound to, and in fact did, bring about the reign of terror by the
        blood-stained men. Who indeed proclaimed the principle that rebellion was a duty? Who fawned on the people by
        proclaiming its sovereignty, which it was incapable of exercising? Who destroyed the awe and sanctity of the
        laws
        by making them depend, not on the sacred principles of justice, not on the natural order, not on civil law, but
        merely on the will of an assembly whose members were ignorant of civil, penal, administrative, political, and

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-435"></a><a href="#calibre_link-935"><span class="t16">{98}</span></a>
        [Manuscript, 1786] Laws are established either by a nation when it submits to a ruler or by the ruler himself.
        In
        the first case, the ruler is obliged by the very nature of his office to carry out the agreed-upon laws without
        exception. In the second case, the laws must serve the end of government, which consists in the peace and
        well-being of the people. If not, it is evident that the people resumes its original status and that the
        government, by not furthering the aim of the social compact, dissolves itself. We shall go even further: the
        compact by which a people places sovereign authority in the hands of some political body is not a contract. That
        is to say, the people has the right to take back at will the sovereignty which it has transferred. Men in the
        state of nature do not form a government. In order to establish one, it was necessary for each individual to
        give
        his consent to the change. The act constituting such a convention is necessarily a reciprocal contract. All men
        thus pledged have made the laws. Thus they have been sovereign.</p>

      <p class="p6">Whether because of the difficulty of assembling frequently or for some other reason, the people
        eventually transferred its authority to a specific man or body of men. Now, no one is bound by obligations
        contracted against his will. There are no prior laws that the people (which under any government whatsoever must
        be regarded as intrinsically sovereign) has not the right to abrogate.</p>

        the
        French are unable to desire anything seriously except, perhaps, equality. Even so, they would gladly renounce it
        if everyone could entertain the hope of rising to the top. Equality in the sense that everyone will be

        symbol of equality. The old orders kept the classes divided, while the new decoration ought to bring about the

        to
        his brother Jérôme, then king of Westphalia, 1807] What the peoples of Germany desire most impatiently is that
        talented commoners should have the same right to your esteem and to public employments as the nobles, that any
        trace of serfdom and of an intermediate hierarchy between the sovereign and the lowest class of the people
        should
        be completely abolished. The benefits of the Code Napoléon, the publicity of judicial procedure, the creation of
        juries must be so many distinguishing marks of your monarchy. And, if I may give you my whole opinion, I count
        more firmly on their effects for the enlargement and consolidation of your kingdom than on the results of even
        the
        greatest military victories. Your people must enjoy a degree of freedom, equality, and prosperity unknown to the
        people of the Germanies, and this liberal regime must produce, in one way or another, the most salutary changes
        affecting the politics of the Confederation of the Rhine and the power of your monarchy. This manner of
        governing
        will give you a more powerful shield against Prussia than the Elbe, fortifications, and French protection. What
        nation would wish to return under the arbitrary Prussian government once it had tasted the benefits of a wise
        and
        liberal administration? The peoples of Germany, the peoples of France, of Italy, of Spain all desire equality
        and
        liberal ideas. I have guided the affairs of Europe for many years now, and I have had occasion to convince
        myself
        that the buzzing of the privileged classes is contrary to the general opinion. Be a constitutional king.</p>

        [Manuscript, 1791] In the past, an unprejudiced writer could have doubts as to which form of government was to
        be
        preferred, the republican or the monarchic; but I believe that today his doubts must have been dispelled.
        Insults,
        calumnies, and threats are being thrown at the republicans...and no reason is given except that a republic is
        impossible in France....Truly, the monarchist orators have greatly contributed to the fall of the monarchy, for
        after wasting all their breath on futile analyses, they invariably end up by saying that the republican form of
        government is impossible because it is impossible.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] I am of the opinion that France should have no constitution: she is an
        essentially monarchic country.</p>

        to
        both chambers, June 7, 1815] It is my ambition to see France enjoying the greatest possible degree of freedom. I
        say <span class="t14">possible,</span> because anarchy inevitably leads back to absolutism.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816, related by Las Cases] The Emperor then made the statement that the extreme
        limit
        of government by many was anarchy, the extreme limit of government by one, despotism; that undoubtedly the best
        choice would lie in the middle road, if only human wisdom were able to follow it. And he made the remark that
        these truths had become hackneyed without being in the least observed.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Same conversation, direct quotation] There is no such thing as absolute despotism. All despotism is
        relative. One man cannot absorb another with impunity. If a sultan has his subjects’ heads cut off because of
        some
        whim, he is likely to lose his own head, and in the same manner. All excess must overflow in one direction or
        another: what the ocean invades in one place it loses in another. And then there are certain customs, certain
        traditions, against which all power comes to nought. When I was in Egypt, conqueror, lord, and absolute master
        though I was, laying down the law to the population by simple decrees, I should not have dared to order the
        houses
        to be searched, and it would have been beyond my power to prevent the population from speaking freely in the
        coffeehouses. They were freer and more independent in their speech than the Parisians. Though they submitted to
        slavery in everything else, they meant to be free in that respect. The coffeehouses were the castles of their
        rights, the market places of their opinions.</p>

        d'état, 1802] In every country, force yields to civic qualities. Bayonets are lowered before the priest who
        speaks
        in the name of Heaven and before the scholar who inspires respect for his science. I have predicted to certain
        military men, who had scruples, that military rule will never take root in France, unless the nation were
        stultified by fifty years of ignorance. All attempts will fail, and their authors will be the victims. I do not
        govern in the capacity of general but by virtue of the civil qualities which in the eyes of the nation qualify
        me
        for the government. If the nation did not hold this opinion, the government would not last. I knew what I was
        doing when, as army commander, I styled myself “Member of the Institute”; I was sure of being understood by the
        last drummer boy.</p>

      <p class="p6">We must not apply the lessons of the barbarian eras to our present times. We are thirty million men
        united by civilization, property, and commerce. Against this mass, three or four hundred thousand soldiers are
        nothing. A general owes his command exclusively to his civic qualities; but aside from this, as soon as his
        active
        employment ceases, he returns to civilian status. Even the soldiers are merely the sons of citizens. The army
        means the nation. Looking at the army without taking these relationships into account, one would become
        convinced
        that it knows no law but force, that it looks only to its own needs, that it sees only itself. The civilian, on
        the contrary, sees only the common good. The distinguishing mark of the military is to want everything
        despotically; that of the civilian is the desire to subject everything to discussion, to the criteria of truth
        and
        reason. Each looks through his own prism, which often misleads him. Nevertheless, discussion gives birth to
        light.
        If men were classified into military and civilians, the result would be the establishment of two orders, whereas
        there is only one nation.</p>

        choose a civilian magistrate.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] In the last analysis, in order to rule one must be a soldier: without spurs and

        to
        Talleyrand, 1797] The English constitution is merely a charter of privileges.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conseil d'état, 1804] The claims put forward by the Senate are echoes of the English constitution;
        but nothing differs more from France than England. The Frenchman lives under a clear sky, drinks fiery and heady
        wines, and eats food which excites the activity of his senses. The Englishman, on the contrary, lives in a humid
        climate, under an almost frigid sun, drinks beer or porter, and consumes great quantities of dairy products. The
        blood of the two nations is not composed of the same elements, and thus their characters could not be the same
        either. The French are vain, light-hearted, daring, and, above all, enamored of equality. They have been
        observed,
        in all epochs of history, to make war on superiority of rank and fortune. The English are proud rather than
        vain,
        they are by nature grave, and they direct their attacks not at frivolous distinctions but at serious abuses.
        They
        are more eager to preserve their own rights than to usurp those of others. Englishmen are at once proud and
        humble, independent and obedient. It is unthinkable to give identical institutions to such dissimilar nations.
        Who, in France, would safeguard the powers of the parliament against a monarch disposing of an army of four
        hundred thousand men&mdash;an army which he is compelled to maintain at all times because of his country’s
        geographical situation?</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] Although the English constitution contains odious, outdated, and ignoble
        details,
        it nevertheless presents the singular phenomenon of producing a beneficial and noble result. Through this result
        and the benefits it confers, the constitution secures the loyalty of the multitude, which fears their loss. But
        is
        it to the objectionable nature of its details that the constitution owes this result? No, on the contrary, the
        constitution is tarnished by it, and its lustre would be far brighter if this great and beautiful mechanism got
        rid of such parasitical vices.</p>

        [Conversation, 1800] My policy is to govern men the way the great majority wants to be governed. This, I
        believe,
        is the only way in which it is possible to acknowledge the sovereignty of the people. By making myself Catholic
        I
        brought the war in the Vendée to an end. By becoming a Moslem I established myself in Egypt. By acting
        ultra-montane I won the minds of the Italians. If I governed a nation of Jews, I should restore the temple of
        Solomon. Thus I shall talk freedom in the free part of Santo Domingo; I shall confirm slavery in the Ile de
        France
        [Mauritius] and even in the slave part of Santo Domingo&mdash;with the reservation that I shall soften and limit
        slavery wherever I maintain it and shall restore order and discipline wherever I maintain freedom.</p>

      <p class="p6">In 1802 the Swiss, in order to put an end to the chronic convulsions of the Helvetic Republic, sent
        a
        deputation to Paris and asked the First Consul to mediate between their irreconcilable factions. Napoleon’s Act
        of
        Mediation (1803) represented a compromise between the new and the old. A mediation between political factions,
        it
        also justified his claim of having mediated between past and present.</p>

      <p class="p6">In the course of the negotiations, Napoleon addressed several long and pregnant messages to the
        Swiss
        deputies. The following three excerpts are taken from them.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-450"></a><a href="#calibre_link-950"><span class="t16">{113}</span></a> [1802]
        The
        federal system is contrary to the interests of large countries, because it leads to the fragmentation of their
        power; but it is very advantageous in small countries, because it preserves their natural vigor in its entirety.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">[1803] You might have introduced a unified administration into your country if that course had been
        recommended by the natural disposition of your social components, by historical factors, and by your relations
        with foreign powers. But these three categories of powerful influences have led you to precisely the opposite
        system. A form of government that is not the result of a long sequence of shared experiences, efforts, and
        endeavors can never take root. Temporary conditions and momentary needs may recommend an opposite system and
        even
        lead to its adoption; but it never lasts.</p>

      <p class="p6">[1803; on the democratic cantons, i.e., the small cantons which were&mdash;and still
        are&mdash;governed by <span class="t14">Landsgemeinden,</span> or popular assemblies of the entire adult male

        for
        both you and me. It is the democratic cantons, it is their form of government, which makes you unique in the
        world
        and which makes you interesting in the eyes of Europe. Without these democracies, you would have nothing to show
        that cannot be found elsewhere. You would have no individual color. Keep well in mind how important it is to
        have
        individual features: they alone prevent the notion of your resembling other nations in any way; they alone
        protect
        you from being confused with other countries or from being incorporated into them.</p>

      <p class="p6">I know very well that the government of these democracies entails many disadvantages and that it
        does
        not stand up to critical examination. But, after all, it has been established for centuries; it has its origins
        in
        the climate, the nature, the needs, and the primitive customs of the inhabitants; it conforms to the local
        genius,
        and one should never argue reason against necessity. The constitutions of the small cantons are irrational, to
        be
        sure, but custom has confirmed them. When custom and reason are at odds, custom always wins out.</p>

      <p class="p6">You would like to abolish or to limit the <span class="t14">Landsgemeinden;</span> but, if so, you
        no
        longer should speak of democracies and republics. Free nations have never tolerated any attempt to deprive them
        of
        the direct exercise of their sovereignty. They neither know nor care for the modern invention of representative
        government, which destroys the essential attributes of a republic. The only limitation permissible to
        legislators
        is the kind of restriction which, without taking away from the people the semblance of directly exercising its
        sovereignty, apportions political influence according to education and property.</p>

      <p class="p6">In Rome, the ballots were counted by classes. The last class comprised the whole mass of the
        proletarians, while the first classes contained a bare few hundred wealthy and illustrious citizens. But the
        populace was no less satisfied and did not feel that immense difference, simply because its vanity was flattered
        by the votes it was allowed to cast, which, counted all together, amounted to no more than the votes of a few
        Roman nobles. Besides, why would you deprive those herdsmen of the only pastime they have?</p>

      <p class="p6">The draft of the French Constitution of 1799 contained an article which proposed a limited tenure

        immovable basis.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conseil d'état, 1803] When creating a new government, it is important not to tie one’s hands by

        consists of the Jacobins and of the ex-privileged classes. Those people do not merely compete for positions or

        [Conversation, 1816, related by Las Cases] “Immorality,” said the Emperor, “is undoubtedly the most fatal defect
        in a sovereign, for it never fails to set a fashionable example....Public morality, on the other hand, is the
        natural complement of all legislation: it is in itself a whole code.” And he asserted that the Revolution, in
        spite of all its horrors, had nonetheless been the true cause of our moral regeneration. “Just as the vilest
        dunghills feed the noblest plants.” Nor did he doubt that his administration would be remembered as the era when

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-457"></a><a href="#calibre_link-797"><span class="t16">{120}</span></a>
        [Conversation, 1801] The grand order that rules the entire world must also regulate each of its parts. At the
        center of a society, like the sun, is the government; the various institutions must revolve around it without
        ever
        straying from their orbits. Thus the government must regulate the mechanism of each institution in such a manner
        that all concur in preserving the general harmony. In the system of the universe, nothing is left to chance; in
        the social system, nothing must be left to individual caprice.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conseil d'état, 1800s] The objection has been made to the draft law on adoption that...it would be
        contrary to the child’s freedom to deprive him of his natural father without his consent.</p>

      <p class="p6">Do you not know that in a state of society it is the law that makes the father? That virtually not a
        single human activity is determined by the simple impulse of man’s will? From childhood on we live under the
        sway
        of laws and habits.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conseil d'état, 1800s] Nothing should be made into a general rule unless it conforms to the public
        interest; whatever serves mere private interest should be permitted only by an exceptional decision of the
        public
        authority.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-458"></a><a href="#calibre_link-798"><span class="t16">{121}</span></a> [Conseil
        d'état, 1806] The law must be limited to general principles. To provide for all its possible applications would
        be
        a futile endeavor. Experience would prove that many of them have been overlooked, and respect for the law would
        prevent any magistrate from speaking for the law when it is silent. Justice would be the loser. It must be left
        to
        the government to enact the details by means of executive rulings. The government can, without any
        inconvenience,
        grope its way and draw its rules from experience. There is no reason why, after three or four years, those among
        the rulings whose wisdom has been proved by experience should not be converted into definitive laws.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Message to the Senate, 1806] The history of all eras teaches us that uniformity of laws is
        essentially harmful to the strength and good organization of empires if it goes beyond the limits prescribed by

      <p class="p6">[Reported saying] The First Consul used to say that one should never attempt to forbid what one
        lacks
        the power to prevent&mdash;that the public authority would risk far less in reforming a defective law than in
        tolerating its violation.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] Laws, which in theory are the prototype of clarity, only too often lead to a
        veritable chaos in their application. Indeed, men and their passions disfigure whatever they touch....One cannot
        escape the arbitrariness of judges except by placing oneself under the despotism of the law....I used to dream
        that it was possible to reduce laws to simple geometric propositions, so that anyone who could read and connect
        two ideas should be able to state the law, but I realized almost right away that this was an absurd ideality.
        However, I should have liked to start from a fixed point, to follow a single road that was known to everybody,
        to
        have no other laws than those written down in the code, and to proclaim once and for all that whatever was not
        in
        the code was null and void. But with lawyers it is not easy to arrive at simplicity. First, they will prove to
        you
        that it is impossible, a veritable chimera; then they will try to prove that it even is incompatible with the
        safety and existence of public authority. Authority, they say, stands alone and constantly faces everybody’s
        improvised machinations: thus it needs weapons which it can keep in reserve for unforeseen cases. So that, what
        with the help of some edicts of Chilperic and Pharamond that may be unearthed if convenient, nobody can say for
        sure that he is safe from being duly and legally hanged.</p>

      <p class="p6">In 1807 General Cervoni, commanding the military region of Marseilles, published the following
        order:
      </p>

      <p class="p6">“Any person who, one month after the publication of this order, is found carrying arms on his person
        shall be imprisoned in the fortress of Saint-Jean in Marseilles. Any brigand arrested carrying weapons shall be
        court-martialed.” (The designation “brigand” was liberally applied at that period to members of the royalist
        underground resistance in western France and in Provence.)</p>

      <p class="p6">In a letter dated from Osterode (East Prussia), March 7, 1807, Napoleon made the following comments
        on
        the order.</p>

      <p class="p6">If it is permissible to say that any Frenchman who possesses a weapon may be deprived of his
        freedom,
        then why not say as well that he shall be sentenced to serve as a galley slave? When the penalty has been
        imposed
        on him, who shall order its execution? Not a court&mdash;for the courts do not make decisions based on the
        orders
        of prefects. It will be the prefect, then, who will both promulgate and execute the law. Thus the prefect will
        be
        at once the legislator, the judge, and the executor of his judgments. If prefects were granted the right to
        order
        the citizens’ houses searched, where would be the limits of their powers? Who would prevent them from ordering
        that any citizen who does not go to Mass, who takes walks at such and such an hour, who does not do this or
        that,
        must undergo such and such a penalty? Thus the safety and freedom of the citizens will be threatened by the zeal
        or the arbitrariness of a single administrator.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">But is it not a grave mistake to inflict infamy on a citizen by forbidding him to carry arms? Every
        nobleman formerly possessed that right. Today, every domiciled Frenchman, every citizen who by his private life
        pledges his loyal conduct to society, is a nobleman.</p>

      <p class="p6">Late in December, 1800, royalist conspirators exploded an infernal machine which killed several
        bystanders and ruined several houses but failed to blow up the carriage in which Napoleon was riding to the
        Opéra.
        Without any evidence, and against Fouché’s opinion, the First Consul decided that the plot was the work of the
        Jacobins, and against the Jacobins he proceeded with unseemly haste. The Conseil d'état, however, correctly
        suspecting the royalists to be the real culprits, engaged Napoleon in debate. Napoleon’s reply is memorable.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conseil d'état, 1801] I suppose that the authors of the crime are a different set from the wretches
        we are discussing here. This does not change the fact that they [the Jacobins] have been plotting for the past
        year, that they have committed every crime, that they are abhorred by the French, that they give the government
        no
        peace, and that they have been involved in every single similar plot discovered in the past year. All the police
        reports are full of their doings. Thus it is permissible to examine the question whether, apart from any direct
        complicity with the authors of the attempt of the 3 Nivôse, the public interest does not require these people to
        be deported.</p>

        Consul on his own law code in 1803, when his brother Lucien married against Napoleon’s will. The notary who had
        registered the marriage contract was summoned to the Tuileries, and the following dialogue took place.</p>

        the act?</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Notary:</span> I do not think so. Your brother has been of age for some time. He
        has

        into any contract.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Bonaparte:</span> But I am the sovereign and, as such, my consent was needed.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Notary:</span> This will be difficult, because it is in due form and every

      <p class="p6">(The notary withdrew with his register. He had not lost his composure for an instant.)</p>

      <p class="p6">In 1810 Napoleon took a decisive step toward despotism by instituting state prisons in which
        political
        offenders could be detained without a regular court procedure. Anxious to save his reputation as a liberal, he
        commented as follows in his memoirs, dictated on Saint Helena.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-463"></a><a href="#calibre_link-803"><span class="t16">{126}</span></a> Napoleon
        desired the strict execution of the law which prescribed that, in all ordinary cases, persons should be handed
        over to a magistrate within twenty-four hours from their arrest. In extraordinary cases, determined by the
        nature
        of circumstances, their exceptional status could not be prolonged beyond one year, and in that case their
        detention had to be ordered by a privy council of sixteen persons acting on the report of the chief of police.
        This administrative ruling may have been the object of thoughtless criticism. A great deal of superficial talk
        goes on at social gatherings. Perhaps the name [state prisons] was a mistake. Those eight establishments should
        have been called “executive prisons for persons under general surveillance.”</p>

        opinion, was to honor the public trust and to extinguish the debt by appropriating to that purpose any kind of
        national domains...and to push that measure so vigorously that within three years the national debt would be
        wiped
        out. He thought that at the same time the following principle should be submitted to popular referendum and be
        transformed into a constitutional law: that a generation cannot be committed by a previous generation and that
        interest on loans could be exacted only for the first fifteen years. This would have prevented the abuse to
        which
        that resource [public loans] can be put, and it would have protected the future generations from the greed of
        the
        present one.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, December, 1812] In England everything is based on something imaginary. Her credit

        government has something better than that, since the individual fortunes are linked to that of the State. The
        system of successive loans, which continually tie the present to the past, in a manner compels confidence in the
        future. By giving every individual proprietor a stake in the wealth of the State, the government creates
        something
        better than a material surety, which it lacks: for it thereby creates an unlimited surety resting on individual
        self-interest.</p>

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-1024"></a><a id="calibre_link-126"></a>ON THE BANK OF FRANCE</h2>

      <p class="p6">In 1800 Napoleon founded the now venerable Bank of France. Its basic functions have changed with the
        times, but some of Napoleon’s views on its operations are still of interest. It must be pointed out that the
        Bank
        of France, though an official institution, is not a state bank but a semiprivate organization.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-468"></a><a href="#calibre_link-808"><span class="t16">{131}</span></a> [Note,
        1808] A bank is founded for the purpose of reducing the interest rate and of maintaining it at the lowest
        possible
        level. As a general proposition it may be said that the prosperity of industry and commerce is inseparable from
        moderate interest rates. Bankers and, to use a popular term, money merchants often allow their operations to be
        invaded by practices which are departures from that purpose. A government bank can neutralize these schemes by
        means of well-directed discounts, and it is their duty thus to channel the operations of the bankers themselves
        toward the aim of public usefulness. Whatever tends to reduce interest rates is in harmony with the spirit of
        the
        Bank of France.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">It is indispensable for the Bank to have a reserve fund of gold coin in order to fulfill its primary
        function&mdash;the immediate conversion of bank notes into coin upon presentation by the bearer. But it would be
        absurd if the Bank were to keep all or the major part of its capital in reserve for the purpose of thus
        functioning as a material sign, for in that case the Bank would make no use of its privilege. It would lose its
        usefulness by not taking advantage of its right to create, through its own money issues, new instruments of
        discount and new values. The Bank would be reduced to the role of the ordinary discount houses, and it would be
        the loser, since it discounts at a lower rate than they, while its huge administration requires much larger
        outlays.</p>

      <p class="p6">The quota of the gold reserve which the Bank must keep out of circulation cannot be calculated
        absolutely. However, supposing that the Bank has discounted only at the regular rates, and only such papers as
        are, by their nature, susceptible of being discounted by the Bank, experience has shown that it should have a
        gold
        reserve no larger than one fourth or one third of the bank notes in circulation. Whatever the Bank is now
        withholding beyond that quota is inactive and unproductive capital.</p>

      <p class="p6">What is the purpose of the Bank of France? To discount all the paper of every commercial firm in
        France at four percent per annum.</p>

        [Conversation, 1801] It seems that trading in securities is the business of every Parisian except such as
        actually
        own property. In effect, all that those so-called buyers and sellers do is bet with one another on the
        prevailing
        market prices on such and such a date. As a consequence, every one of them, in order to win his bet, takes it
        into
        his head to guide the destinies of Europe so as to conform with his aims. Everybody invents facts, comments on
        facts, disfigures facts; everybody worms his way into the councils and cabinets of ministers, into the secrets
        of
        the courts; everybody pumps the ambassadors, disposes of war and peace, and stirs up and misleads public
        opinion,
        which is so eager for news and for lies, especially in France, that the more a man deceives it the more he is
        believed. And this scandalous influence is exerted not only by that crowd of adventurers known as speculators:
        even the stockbrokers, who are debarred from speculating on their own account, abuse their positions and make
        deals for their own profit. Often they act against the interests of those they call their clients. If for no
        other
        motive but the good of public morality, this abuse must be stopped; and there are many other motives. The rights
        of freedom cease where abuses begin.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-470"></a><a href="#calibre_link-810"><span class="t16">{133}</span></a>
        [Conversation, 1816] Democracy establishes sovereignty; aristocracy alone preserves it.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Dictation, Saint Helena] There always exists an aristocracy, regardless of nations and revolutions.
        If you suppress it in the nobility, it immediately transfers itself to the rich and powerful families of the
        bourgeoisie. If you rout it out there, it rides out the flood and takes refuge in factory foremen and popular
        leaders. A ruler gains nothing by such shifts of the aristocracy; he restores order to everything by letting it
        subsist in its natural state and by reconstituting the old houses on the basis of new principles.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Dictation, Saint Helena] In establishing a hereditary nobility, Napoleon had three aims: (1) to
        reconcile France with Europe; (2) to reconcile the old France with the new; (3) to wipe out in Europe the
        remnants
        of feudalism by associating the idea of nobility with that of public service and dissociating it from any feudal
        concept.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] I repeat it again: I have done either too much or too little. I should have won
        over the émigré nobles as soon as they returned. It would have been easy to make the aristocrats adore me, and I
        certainly needed an aristocracy. It is the true, the only support of a monarchy, its moderator, its lever, its
        stronghold. Without it, the State is a rudderless ship, a balloon drifting in the air. Now, the advantage, the
        magic of an aristocracy lies in its antiquity, in time&mdash;and these were the only things I could not create.

      <p class="p6">The following remarks were made by Napoleon in the Conseil d'état during the early years of the
        Empire.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-471"></a><a href="#calibre_link-811"><span class="t16">{134}</span></a> Property
        is the fundamental basis of any political association.</p>

      <p class="p6">What is the right of property? It is the right not only to use but also to abuse.</p>

      <p class="p6">There are general rules laid down in the interest of society which no property owner has the right
        to
        break on the pretext that he has the right to use and abuse things. For instance, I would not tolerate that any
        individual should render unproductive twenty square leagues of wheat-producing land in order to create a park
        for
        himself. The right to abuse does not extend to the point of depriving the people of its subsistence.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Concerning safety in mines] It is better to allow private interest to take care of this matter than
        to establish supervision by engineers. A government is in grave error if it wants to be too paternal. By dint of
        solicitude it destroys freedom and property.</p>

      <p class="p6">All legislation must favor the property owner. He must find his profit in putting to use his
        property;
        otherwise he will abandon his enterprises. He must be given great freedom of action, for whatever hinders the
        free
        use of property irks the citizen.</p>

      <p class="p6">To this end you will warn the legislator not to sanction laws that would enable a few to own
        everything. The lawgiver must solve his political problem in such a way that even the poorest own something. By

        room
        for inequality in the interval. Whether he lives in a hut or a palace, clothed in skins or in brocade, eating as

        They are needed at Cherbourg, in the swamps at Rochefort, at Fort Boyard. Could not these men be militarily

        but their tools.</p>

      <p class="p6">3. A military police sergeant with two corporals and twelve mounted military policemen will be
        attached to each pioneer battalion, under the orders of the battalion commander.</p>

      <p class="p6">4. The first battalion will be formed in Cherbourg; the second, in a place still to be designated,

        sentences will be taken to any one of these four depots in order to be enrolled and incorporated into the

        be made to work as much as possible.</p>

        property owners, the price of wheat is the one on which their interests are most sharply opposed. It also is,
        perhaps, the only matter in which the government must always favor the proletarians against the propertied

        would
        dispense an economic brew devised by that inventive Yankee, Count Rumford. However, the soup was not to be given

        of
        asking for charity and yet find it very helpful, especially for his children, to be able to buy soup cheaply. It
        is more advantageous for the people to sell them the soup than to give it away free, for free distributions are

        [Manuscript, 1786] It is axiomatic that Christianity, even the reformed kind, destroys the unity of the State:
        (1)
        because it is capable of weakening as well as of inspiring the trust which the people owe the representatives of
        the law; (2) because, such as it is constituted, Christianity contains a separate body which not only claims a
        share of the citizens’ loyalty but is able even to counteract the aims of the government. And, besides, is it
        not
        true that that body [the clergy] is independent of the State? Surely this is so, since it is not subject to the
        same rules. Is it known for defending the fatherland, law, and freedom? No. Its kingdom is not of this world.
        Consequently, it is never civic-minded.</p>

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-1032"></a><a id="calibre_link-134"></a>THE POLITICAL USE OF RELIGION</h2>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-482"></a><a href="#calibre_link-844"><span class="t16">{145}</span></a>
        [Conversation, 1816] When I seized the helm, I already had settled ideas about all the principal elements that
        make for the cohesion of society. I had fully weighed the importance of religion. My mind was made up, and I
        resolved to restore the Church. But it is hard to believe how much resistance I had to overcome in order to
        bring
        Catholicism back. I would have found more willing support if I had hoisted the Protestant banner....There is no
        doubt that after the disorder to which I succeeded, in the ruins on which I found myself placed, I was free to
        choose between Catholicism and Protestantism. It is also true to say that the times entirely favored the latter.
        But, quite aside from the fact that my native religion really meant something to me, my decision was founded on
        reasons of the highest order. If I had proclaimed Protestantism, what would have been the result? I would have
        divided France into two parties of approximately equal strength, whereas I wanted to have no more parties at
        all.
        I would have revived the fury of religious quarrels just when the spirit of the times and my own will aimed at
        making them vanish forever. In rending each other, these two parties would have annihilated France and made her
        the slave of Europe&mdash;when I had the ambition to make her Europe’s mistress. With Catholicism, I was sure to
        succeed in all my great plans. At home, in France, the majority was sure to swallow up the minority, and I was
        resolved to treat the minority on a basis of equality such that soon there would have been no noticeable
        difference. Abroad, Catholicism was to keep the pope favorably disposed toward me&mdash;and what with my
        influence
        and my troops in Italy, I had reason to hope that sooner or later, one way or another, I would end up by
        controlling that pope. And after that&mdash;what influence! What a lever on public opinion throughout the world!
      </p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816, reported in English] My intention was to render everything pertaining to the
        State and to the constitution purely civil and independent of any religion. I wished to deprive the priests of
        all
        influence and power in civil affairs and to oblige them to confine themselves to their own spiritual matters and
        meddle with nothing else.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Dictation, Saint Helena] It is an established fact, which the future will prove ever more clearly,

        enhance
        the prestige of France and the influence of Paris, which were the ends of all his thoughts. At that price he
        would

        Now, is it possible to imagine anything so absurd as an absolute prohibition imposed by the divine law against
        ever shaking off the yoke of a tyrant&mdash;even if he is a usurper? Thus an assassin clever enough to seize the

        failed, he would have been sentenced to have his criminal head cut off on the scaffold. Do not tell me he will

        [Conversation, 1817] Moses was a clever man, and the Jews are a vile people, cowardly and cruel.</p>

      <p class="p6">Napoleon’s deeply ingrained prejudice against the Jews was aggravated in 1806 by reports to the
        effect
        that entire districts in Alsace had been mortgaged to Jewish moneylenders. (Most of the Jews in France were then
        concentrated in Alsace.) Napoleon’s first reaction was violent, as will be seen. Yet the lawgiver conquered the
        bigot. Instead of following up his first impulse, Napoleon sought to solve the Jewish problem by a legislation
        which, though characteristically highhanded, aimed at complete assimilation of the Jews. Whatever the faults of
        his program, the following excerpts testify to the originality of his thought and illustrate the abyss that
        divides a Napoleon from a Hitler.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-490"></a><a href="#calibre_link-852"><span class="t16">{153}</span></a> [Conseil
        d'état, April 30, 1806] The French government cannot stand by indifferently while a contemptible and degraded
        nation which is capable of the lowest deeds assumes exclusive ownership of the two beautiful departments of old
        Alsace. The Jews must be regarded as a nation, not as a sect. They are a nation within the nation....</p>

      <p class="p6">It is necessary to forestall by legal measures the arbitrary sanctions which otherwise may have to
        be
        applied against the Jews, or else they would risk being massacred one day by the Christian population of Alsace,
        as has frequently happened, and almost always through their own fault....</p>

      <p class="p6">It would be dangerous to let the keys of France&mdash;Strasbourg and Alsace&mdash;fall into the
        hands
        of a nation of spies who have no attachment to the fatherland. Formerly, the Jews were not even allowed to spend
        the night in Strasbourg. Perhaps it would be advisable to enact a law which would set the number of Jews
        permitted
        to reside in the departments of Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin at fifty thousand. The excess of that population could
        spread itself through the rest of France at will.</p>

      <p class="p6">One also might forbid them to practice commerce, on the ground that they dishonor it by taking
        usury,
        and void their past transactions as being tainted by fraud.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Decree, May 30, 1806] These circumstances [i.e., the alleged conditions in Alsace] have also

        sense of civic morality which unfortunately has been blunted in too many of them by the degraded status in which
        they have always been kept. To maintain or restore that status does not enter into Our intentions.</p>

      <p class="p6">In order to accomplish this purpose, We have resolved to call an assembly of the foremost Jews and
        to
        communicate Our intentions to them through commissioners whom We shall nominate to that end. These commissioners
        will at the same time receive the Jews’ proposals concerning the most expedient methods of reviving the exercise
        of useful arts and professions among their brethren, so that the shameful practices by which many of them have
        earned their livelihood through the generations may be replaced by honorable industriousness.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-491"></a><a href="#calibre_link-853"><span class="t16">{154}</span></a> [Note to
        the minister of the interior, August 23, 1806, on the assembly of the Jews] Not since the capture of Jerusalem
        by
        Titus have so many enlightened men belonging to the religion of Moses been able to assemble in one place.
        Dispersed and persecuted, the Jews have been subjected either to punitive taxation, or to enforced abjuration of
        their faith, or to other obligations and concessions equally opposed to their interests and religion. Present
        circumstances are in all respects unlike those prevailing in any earlier age. The Jews are not expected to
        abandon
        their religion or to submit to any change that would violate it either in the letter or in the spirit.</p>

      <p class="p6">During the persecution of the Jews and during the periods when they went into hiding in order to
        escape persecution, various kinds of doctrines and customs came into existence. The rabbis took it upon
        themselves
        to interpret the principles of their faith whenever there was need for clarification. But the right to religious
        legislation cannot be exercised by individuals; it must be exercised by a general congress of Jews legally and
        freely assembled, including members of the Spanish and Portuguese, Italian, German, and French communities and
        representing the Jews of more than three fourths of Europe.</p>

      <p class="p6">Consequently, it appears that the first thing to be done is to constitute the assembly now meeting
        in
        Paris into a Great Sanhedrin whose acts will take their place alongside the Talmud as articles of faith and as
        principles of religious legislation.</p>

      <p class="p6">When this has been accomplished, all Jews of whatever nation are to be invited to send
        representatives
        to Paris and to put their wisdom at the disposal of the deliberations of the Great Sanhedrin. Accordingly, all
        the
        synagogues of Europe are to be notified by some form of proclamation. This notification shall be officially
        addressed to the synagogues of France. The replies that will be made to the questions put before the Great
        Sanhedrin shall be converted into theological rulings or precepts in such a manner that they shall have the
        authority of ecclesiastic and religious law and shall constitute a second legislation of the Jews. This second
        legislation, while preserving the essential character of the Mosaic law, shall be adapted to the present
        situation
        of the Jews and to modern ways and customs.</p>

      <p class="p6">The following questions have been submitted, to wit:</p>

      <p class="p6">1. Are Jews permitted to marry several wives?&mdash;The answer must be clearly in the negative, and
        polygamy must be forbidden in Europe by the present assembly or by the Great Sanhedrin.</p>

      <p class="p6">2 Is divorce allowed by the Jewish religion? Is a divorce valid without having been granted by the
        courts and on the strength of laws which conflict with those of the French nation?&mdash;The assembly in its
        capacity of Great Sanhedrin must forbid divorce except in such cases as are provided for by the civil law or the
        Code Napoléon and are granted by the civil authority.</p>

      <p class="p6">3 Is a Jewess allowed to marry a Christian, or a Christian woman a Jew? Or does the law demand that
        Jews marry only among themselves?&mdash;The Great Sanhedrin will have to declare that no religious marriage can
        take place until after a couple has been pronounced married by the civil authority and that Jews and Jewesses
        are
        free to marry Frenchmen or Frenchwomen. It even is necessary that the Great Sanhedrin recommend such mixed
        unions
        as a means of protecting and benefiting the Jewish people.</p>

      <p class="p6">4. Do the Jews regard Frenchmen as their brethren or as aliens?&mdash;Acknowledging, as the assembly
        has done, that Frenchmen and Jews are brothers, the Sanhedrin shall lay down this principle: that the Jews are
        the
        brothers of all the inhabitants of those countries where they are afforded not merely toleration but also
        protection and where they are admitted to the exercise of all the privileges attached to political and civil
        existence. In this respect, the Sanhedrin shall stress the difference between French and Italian legislation and
        the legislation in other countries.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">6. Do the Jews who were born in France and whom French law treats as French citizens regard France
        as
        their fatherland? Are they obliged by their laws to defend France, to obey her laws, and to conform to all the
        provisions of the Civil Code?&mdash;The Sanhedrin must declare that the Jews are obliged to defend France as
        they
        would defend Jerusalem, since they are treated in France as they would be in the Holy City....</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">11. Are Jews forbidden by their law to make usurious loans to their coreligionists?</p>

      <p class="p6">12. Does their law forbid them or permit them to make usurious loans to aliens?&mdash;The Sanhedrin
        shall forbid usury toward Frenchmen and toward the inhabitants of any country where the Jews enjoy full civil
        rights. It shall put this interpretation upon the Mosaic law by stating that the Jews must regard all places
        where
        they are citizens as they would regard Jerusalem; that they are strangers only in those places where the law of
        the land subjects them to persecution and vexatious treatment; and that it is only in the last-named countries
        that their religious law may tolerate illicit gains. Once this point has been settled by the Sanhedrin, an
        attempt
        should be made to study the question whether efficacious methods can be found to restrain and repress their
        habitual propensity to shady deals, their organized system of usury and fraud.</p>

      <p class="p6">All this is intended merely to serve as a directive to the commissioners. They will understand what
        is
        wanted of them, and they will start out by finding the means of accomplishing it. They will confer particularly
        with the most influential members of the assembly. They will declare that I am pleased by the zeal that animates
        its members. They will impress on them that these are extraordinary circumstances and that I wish to make
        certain
        by all available means that the rights which have been restored to the Jewish people shall not prove illusory,
        so
        that they may find Jerusalem in France.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Letter to the minister of the interior, Poznan, November 29, 1806] Out of every three marriages in
        each of the administrative districts of the Sanhedrin or consistory, no more than two marriages between Jews and

        seems too difficult to carry out, it will be necessary to take steps which will lead to that end by way of
        exhortation, education, incentives, and command.</p>

        classes. However, the following ideas on the role of high schools may be read with profit in our own days.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Letter to the minister of the interior, 1807] A young man of sixteen, upon leaving his <span

        applied to solids and liquids.</p>

      <p class="p6">Whether he wants to enter a legal, military, ecclesiastic, or literary career; whether he intends to
        become a scientist, geographer, engineer, or surveyor&mdash;in each case he has received the common educational
        basis which is necessary to prepare him for the additional education required by these professions. And when he
        has reached a decision on the choice of his profession, the specialized studies are open to him.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-495"></a><a href="#calibre_link-857"><span class="t16">{158}</span></a> [Letter
        to
        the rector of the University of Bologna, 1805] Avoid everything that might give false ideas of the truth.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Note on the <span class="t14">lycées,</span> 1805] Perhaps the time will soon come when we must
        deal
        with the question whether teachers should be organized as a corps. Should this corps or order be a religious
        association, take vows of chastity, renounce the world, etc.? There seems to be no connection between these
        ideas.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">In its present state, the teaching personnel consists of principals, proctors, and professors. A
        teachers’ corps would come into existence if all the principals, proctors, and professors of the Empire were
        subordinate to one or several head officials, just as the Jesuits were subordinate to a general, to provincials,
        etc.; if in order to be principal or proctor it would be necessary to have been a professor first; if in order
        to
        teach in the upper grades professors first would have to teach in the lower ones; and, finally, if there existed
        in the teaching career a progressive system of promotion that would stimulate competition, so that at every
        stage
        in his life a teacher had something to hope for and aim at. A man who has devoted his life to teaching ought not
        to marry before having passed through several stages of his career. For him as for anyone else, marriage ought
        to
        be a goal that is always before his eyes but that he can reach only after he has secured his place in society
        and
        his financial independence by obtaining a position sufficiently remunerative to enable him to live as the head
        of
        a family without abandoning his chosen career. Thus the teaching career would be subject to the same conditions
        as
        the other civil service careers.</p>

      <p class="p6">This corps would have its own <span class="t14">esprit.</span> The Emperor would extend his
        protection
        to its most distinguished members and through his favors raise them to a higher position in public esteem than
        that of the priests in the times when their orders were regarded as a kind of patent of nobility. Everybody used
        to be aware of the importance of the Jesuits; the importance of the teachers’ corporation would be quickly
        realized if the public saw a talented man, after receiving his education at a <span class="t14">lycée,</span>
        called to teach in his turn, advance from grade to grade, and take his place in the first ranks of the State
        before completing his career.</p>

      <p class="p6">Of all political questions, this one deserves perhaps the most attention. There will be no political
        stability so long as there is no teaching body based on stable principles. So long as children are not taught
        whether they must be republicans or monarchists, Catholics or freethinkers, etc., the State will not constitute
        a
        nation but rest on vague and shifting foundations, ever exposed to disorder and change.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Speech on the university, 1810] The lowest ranking professors in our <span
          class="t14">lycées</span>
        are important magistrates. They are not boarding-school keepers, major-domos, or hired servants: they walk with
        their heads high, side by side with the parents, whose equals they are. They do not assume the countenance of
        salaried personnel when facing the parents; they do not subordinate their principles to fads and fashions; they
        are not obliged to give in to vexatious and puerile demands: they are in a position to do all the good which
        they
        have been called upon to achieve.</p>

      <p class="p6">Lastly, I want to put into practice, in a country of forty million people, what Sparta and Athens
        did
        and what the religious orders attempted to do in modern times&mdash;with incomplete success, since they worked
        separately: I want a corps that is sheltered from the petty excitements of fashion, a corps which keeps marching
        on even when the government dozes, a corps whose administration and regulations are to become so intimately
        linked
        with the interests of the whole people that no one could ever dare to undo it.</p>

      <p class="p6">If my hopes become reality, I want this corps to stand as a guarantee against any of the pernicious
        theories that would subvert the social order in one direction or another. In every well-organized State there
        always has been a body whose responsibility it was to set the rules and principles of morality and politics.
        Such
        was the University of Paris and later the Sorbonne; such are, in Italy, the universities of Pavia, Pisa, and
        Padua; in Germany, those of Göttingen and Jena; in Spain, the University of Salamanca; in England, that of
        Oxford;
        in Turkey, the college of Ulemas. These bodies, being foremost in the defense of the cause of morality and the
        principles of the State, are the first to sound the alarm and are always prepared to resist the dangerous
        theories
        of those who are constantly intent on being unlike other men and who, at recurring intervals, renew those futile
        arguments which everywhere and all too frequently have inflamed public opinion.</p>

      <p class="p6">A frustrated newspaperman, Napoleon was the author of innumerable editorials, notices, book and art
        reviews, and other unsigned items which appeared in the official and semi-official press, such as the <span
          class="t14">Moniteur Universel</span> and the <span class="t14">Journal de l’Empire.</span> He carried on a
        particularly spirited feud with the English press, which infuriated him beyond all reason. Among the educated
        class, Napoleon’s efforts&mdash;for his authorship was transparent&mdash;created amusement rather than the
        desired
        effect. Since memoirs and history are written by the educated class, the view has come to prevail that
        Napoleon’s
        journalism did him more harm than good. This may be so, but it is difficult to assess the impact of his prose on
        the mass of the readers. The typical diatribe from which the following excerpt is taken was published in the
        <span class="t14">Moniteur</span> in May, 1803, in answer to the message of King George III to Parliament on the
        renewal of warfare between France and England.

        France
        had had ambitious projects and ideas of aggrandizement, would she not have kept all of Italy under her direct
        influence? Would she not have annexed the Batavian Republic, Switzerland, and Portugal? Instead of making these
        easy acquisitions, she wisely offers to limit her territory and her power, and she accepts the loss of the huge
        territory of Santo Domingo as well as of the large sums of money and the armies that have been sent to recover
        that colony. She makes every sacrifice so that peace may continue.</p>

      <p class="p6">England, on the contrary, seizes the whole of the wealthy island of Ceylon and all shipping in the
        Gulf of Bengal. She acquires the important colony of Trinidad. She tries to invade Egypt by means of a secret
        treaty with the Mamelukes and by sending them arms and ammunition. She evacuates Alexandria only long after the
        term agreed upon has expired, and then merely because she is afraid of a plague epidemic. She violates the
        Treaty
        of Amiens [of 1802] in order to keep Malta, to displace the Barbary Pirates, to gain a trade monopoly in the
        Adriatic, the Levant, the Dardanelles, and the Black Sea, and to close the Mediterranean to the ships of all
        nations. She does everything in her power to make France lose Santo Domingo and to prevent her from making use
        of
        Louisiana. She stirs up dissension among the Swiss cantons and supplies munitions and arms to feed their civil
        war. She sends fleets to the northern seas, off Texel and the [mouth of the] Meuse, threatening to invade
        Holland.
        She covets Sicily, asks for the island of Lampedusa, and occupies Sardinia. The four quarters of the world, all
        the gulfs, capes, straits, and rich colonies are not enough to satisfy her political and commercial cupidity.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">At last her greed and her ambitions are out in the open. The mask is down: England allows but
        thirty-six more hours to the duration of the peace. She has speculated on sudden war so that she may seize at
        one
        fell swoop, on all the high seas, all the riches that had long been stored in warehouses and that the Spanish,
        Portuguese, and Dutch colonies were able at long last to send to their mother countries, as well as the warships
        of the French Republic and the commercial vessels which had barely begun to revive our trade. For the sake of
        indulging her malignant and all too powerful passions, England disturbs the peace of the world, wantonly
        violates
        the rights of nations, tramples underfoot the most solemn treaties, and breaks her pledged faith&mdash;that
        ancient, eternal faith which even savage hordes acknowledge and respect religiously.</p>

      <p class="p6">One sole obstacle stands in the way of her policies and her ambitious course&mdash;victorious,
        moderate, prosperous France; her vigorous and enlightened government; her illustrious and magnanimous leader.
        These are the targets of England’s delirious envy, of her repeated assaults, of her implacable hatred, of her
        diplomatic intrigues, of her maritime conspiracies, and of the official denunciations to her Parliament and
        subjects. But Europe watches; France arms; History writes; Rome destroyed Carthage!</p>

        [Austerlitz, December 3, 1805] On December 1 the Emperor, from the height of his bivouac, observed with
        indescribable joy that the Russian army, almost within artillery range from his outposts, was beginning a
        flanking
        movement intended to turn his right. He could see then to what extent presumptuousness and ignorance of the art
        of
        war had misled the councils of that brave army. He said several times, “Before tomorrow night this army will be
        mine.” Meanwhile, the enemy displayed quite a different mood. They exposed themselves at pistol range from our
        main guard. They strung themselves out over a line four leagues long in a flanking march alongside the French
        army, which appeared to be afraid of leaving its positions. The enemy’s only fear was that the French army might
        elude them. Everything was done to confirm them in that notion. Prince Murat ordered a small body of cavalry to
        advance into the plain, but suddenly, as if astonished at seeing the enemy’s huge forces, it hastily retreated.
        Thus everything tended to confirm the Russian commander in the ill-calculated plan he had decided upon....</p>

      <p class="p6">At nightfall, the Emperor wished to visit all the bivouacs, on foot and incognito, but no sooner had
        he walked a few steps than he was recognized. It would be impossible to describe the soldiers’ enthusiasm when
        they saw him. Instantly, straw torches were tied to thousands of poles, and eighty thousand men turned to the
        Emperor, greeting him with cheers&mdash;some in order to celebrate the anniversary of his coronation [December
        2,
        1804], some shouting that the army would present its bouquet to him on the morrow. One of the oldest grenadiers
        stepped up to him and said, “Sire, you won’t have to take any chances with your person. I promise you in the
        name
        of the grenadiers of the army that you won’t have to fight with anything except your eyes and that we’ll bring
        you
        the flags and the guns of the Russian army to celebrate the anniversary of your coronation tomorrow.”</p>

      <p class="p6">Returning to his bivouac, which consisted of a ramshackle and roofless hut built for him out of
        straw
        by the grenadiers, the Emperor said: “This is the finest evening of my life. But I am sorry at the thought that
        I
        shall lose a good many of those brave people. By the sadness this causes me I can feel that they are indeed my
        children&mdash;and, to tell the truth, I sometimes blame myself for this feeling, for I fear that it will end up
        by spoiling me for war.”...</p>

      <p class="p6">On December 2, dawn came at last. The sun rose radiant, and that anniversary of the Emperor’s
        coronation, on which one of the most glorious feats of the century was to take place, was one of the finest
        autumn
        days.</p>

      <p class="p6">This battle, which the soldiers persist in calling the Three Emperors’ Battle, which others call the
        Battle of the Anniversary, and which the Emperor has named the Battle of Austerlitz, will be forever memorable
        in
        the annals of our great nation.</p>

      <p class="p6">Passing in front of several regiments in battle array, the Emperor said, “Soldiers! We must end this
        battle with a thunderclap that will confound the arrogance of our enemies”; and instantly their hats waving at
        the
        ends of their bayonets and shouts of <span class="t14">Vive l’Empereur!</span> gave the actual signal for the
        battle to begin. A second later, gunfire could be heard from the extreme right, which had already been by-passed
        by the enemy vanguard. But their unforeseen encounter with Marshal Davout stopped the enemy short, and the
        fighting began.</p>

      <p class="p6">Marshal Soult began to move at the same instant, making for the heights of the village of Pratzen
        with
        the divisions of generals Vandamme and Saint-Hilaire, and completely cut off the enemy’s right, whose actions
        became altogether uncertain. Surprised in their movement by a flanking march, finding themselves attacked when
        they had thought that they were the attackers, they looked upon themselves as half defeated.</p>

      <p class="p6">Prince Murat passed to the attack with his cavalry. The left, under the command of Marshal Lannes,
        marched in echelons, regiment by regiment, as on the parade ground. A terrible artillery duel began along the
        whole line. The noise of two hundred guns and nearly two hundred thousand men was terrifying. It was a true
        battle
        of giants. The fighting had lasted less than an hour when the entire enemy left had been cut off. Their right
        had
        already reached Austerlitz, where the emperors of Russia and of Austria had their headquarters. The emperors
        were
        obliged to throw the Russian imperial guards into the battle without delay in an attempt to restore
        communications
        between the center and the left. The cavalry of the Russian imperial guards charged and overran a battalion of
        our
        fourth regiment of the line; but the Emperor was not far; he noticed their maneuver, he ordered Marshal
        Bessières
        to come to the aid of the right with his invincibles, and soon the two guards were locked in combat.</p>

      <p class="p6">The issue could not be in doubt: after a short time the Russian guard was routed. Their colonel,
        their
        artillery, their standards, everything was captured. The regiment of Grand Duke Constantine was crushed; he
        himself owed his escape only to the speed of his horse.</p>

      <p class="p6">From the heights of Austerlitz, the two emperors were watching the defeat of the Russian guards. At
        the same time the center of our army, commanded by Marshal Bernadotte, began to advance. Three of its regiments
        supported a very gallant cavalry charge. The left, under Marshal Lannes, charged three times. All the charges
        were
        victorious. The division of General Caffarelli distinguished itself. The cuirassier divisions captured the enemy
        batteries.</p>

      <p class="p6">At one o'clock in the afternoon the victory was decided. It had never been in doubt for a moment.
        Not
        a single soldier of the reserve had been needed, and none had been used. The cannonade continued only on our
        right. The enemy corps which had been surrounded and dislodged from all the heights was now in a depression,
        with
        its back against a lake. The Emperor attacked it with twenty artillery pieces. This corps was hunted from
        position
        to position, and a horrible spectacle could be seen...: twenty thousand men throwing themselves into the water
        and
        drowning in the lake!<a id="calibre_link-508"></a><a href="#calibre_link-870"><span
            class="t16">{171}</span></a>...</p>

      <p class="p6">Never did a battlefield look more horrible. From the middle of the immense lake, the screams of
        thousands of men could be heard, but there was no way of coming to their aid. It will take three days before all
        the enemy wounded can be evacuated to Brünn; one’s heart bleeds. May all this bloodshed, may all these miseries
        be
        avenged at last on the perfidious islanders who are responsible. May the cowardly oligarchs in London be visited
        with punishment for so much suffering!</p>

      <p class="p6">Seven years later to the day, December 3, 1812, Napoleon at Molodechno dictated the famous 29<span
          class="t17">th</span> Bulletin, on the retreat of the <span class="t14">Grande Armée</span> from Moscow. The
        larger portion of the Bulletin is given below.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-509"></a><a href="#calibre_link-871"><span class="t16">{172}</span></a> The
        frost,
        which had begun on November 7, suddenly became more intense, and from November 14 to 15 and 16, the thermometer
        sank to 16°C. and 18°C. below freezing [2.2° and -0.4°F.]. The roads were covered with ice. The horses of the
        cavalry, artillery, and supply service died every night, not by the hundreds, but by the thousands, especially
        those coming from France and Germany. More than thirty thousand horses perished within a few days. Our whole
        cavalry found itself on foot; our artillery and transports were paralyzed. It was necessary to abandon and
        destroy
        a large part of our guns, our ammunition, and our victuals.</p>

      <p class="p6">This army, so splendid on the 6<span class="t17">th</span>, was quite changed by the 14<span
          class="t17">th</span>, with almost no cavalry, no artillery, no supplies. Without cavalry, we were unable to
        send scouts farther than a quarter mile&mdash;and yet, without artillery, we could not risk a battle and wait
        passively to be attacked. We were obliged to march so as to avoid a battle, which our lack of ammunition made
        undesirable; we had to occupy a certain amount of space so as not to be turned, and that without any cavalry
        troops for reconnoitering and for keeping the columns in touch with one another. This difficulty, added to the
        sudden frost, put us into a serious situation. Those men whom nature had not tempered and hardened against all
        accidents of fate and fortune seemed shaken; they lost their laughter and good humor and saw nothing ahead but
        disasters and catastrophes. Those whom she had created superior to everything kept up their good spirits, their
        ordinary manners, and regarded the various ordeals that lay ahead of them as challenges to yet another glorious
        deed.</p>

      <p class="p6">The enemy, seeing the roads littered with the traces of this horrible calamity that had struck the
        French, sought to profit from it. He surrounded all our columns with his Cossacks, who, like the Arabs of the
        desert, made off with all the wagons and carriages that strayed from the road. This contemptible cavalry, which
        makes a great deal of noise but is incapable of breaking through a company of light infantry, became redoubtable
        because of the circumstances. However, the enemy had cause to regret whatever serious attempts he chose to make:
        he was thrown back by the viceroy [Eugène Beauharnais], whom he had sought to stop, and had many casualties in
        the
        fighting....</p>

      <p class="p6">Meanwhile the enemy had occupied all the possible crossings of the Berezina. This river is about two
        hundred and fifty feet wide. It was carrying ice floes in considerable quantity, and along its shores there are
        swamps stretching for two thousand feet, which make it a difficult obstacle to cross.</p>

      <p class="p6">The enemy commander [Kutuzov] had placed his four divisions at the various passages where he
        supposed
        the French army would wish to cross.</p>

      <p class="p6">At dawn on November 26 the Emperor, after deceiving the enemy by various maneuvers on the 25<span
          class="t17">th</span>, made for the village of Studenka and immediately ordered two bridges to be thrown
        across
        the river. This was done in his presence and in the face of an enemy division. The duke of Reggio crossed the
        river, attacked the enemy, and battled him for two hours. The enemy withdrew to the bridgehead at Borisov.
        General
        Legrand, an officer of the highest merit, was seriously but not dangerously wounded. All through November 26 and
        27, the army passed....</p>

      <p class="p6">There follows a description of the military miracles performed during the passage, but on the
        nightmarish sufferings Napoleon keeps silence. The bulletin&mdash;which preceded the Emperor to Paris by only
        one
        day&mdash;concludes as follows.</p>

      <p class="p6">Our cavalry had lost so many horses that it became necessary to make a single unit of all the
        officers
        who still had their mounts and to organize them into four companies of one hundred fifty men each. The generals
        served as captains, the colonels as non-commissioned officers. This sacred squadron, commanded by General
        Grouchy
        under the orders of the king of Naples [Murat], did not lose sight of the Emperor wherever he went.</p>

        to
        Fouché, 1808] I want you to put into the newspapers of Holland, Germany, and even Paris&mdash;but by indirect
        channels and under varying date lines&mdash;some articles that will warn of a coming expedition against Sicily.
        For instance, in one of them it might be said that there are only four regiments in Sicily&mdash;Englishmen, or
        émigrés, or mercenaries in English pay&mdash;adding up to four thousand men in all. In another article, it could
        be said that the first news of preparations [for a landing] has caused alarm in Sicily, that bronze cannons have
        been placed aboard the ships, and that the [Sicilian] court has packed all its valuables. In yet another, that
        King Joachim [Murat, of Naples] is going to Reggio. In another, that two French divisions, each nine thousand
        strong, are being assembled in Calabria. Finally, when these items have circulated for a week, announce in the
        Dutch newspapers that King Joachim has landed in Sicily with thirty thousand Frenchmen, Italians, and
        Neapolitans.
        To give some detail, you might say that he landed at the Punta del Faro, that General Regnier commands one of
        the
        divisions, General Parthonneaux another, General Lamarque a third. Have it repeated in other papers, under
        different date lines, that before his departure the king left the regency to the queen. In a word, use every
        means
        to focus public attention on the Sicilian expedition, so that it will be believed in London and cause alarm.
        This
        must be cleverly handled. It must be the result of information coming from every side and the work of a dozen or
        so well-timed articles in the several papers.</p>

        to promote perspiration&mdash;was much better than mine.</p>

        active
        remedies, which he declined doing, observing that he never had taken any medicine since his childhood; that he
        knew his own constitution and was convinced that even a small dose would probably produce violent effects; that,
        moreover, its effects would perhaps be contrary to the efforts of nature.</p>

        should say yes without any hesitation,” said the Emperor. “But if I became gravely ill, perhaps I would change
        my

        medicine. But surgery, he observed, was a different matter. Three times, he said, he had started taking a course
        in anatomy, but each time his public business and his disgust forced him to break it off. “On one occasion,” he
        went on, “as a result of a long discussion we had had, Corvisart wanted to convince me by presenting tangible
        evidence, and with the most abominable malice he came out to Saint-Cloud with a stomach wrapped in a pocket

        Emperor maintained that it was transmitted through breathing as well as through direct contact. He said that its
        greatest danger was fear, that fear caused its spread more than anything else, and that its principal seat was
        in
        the imagination. During the Egyptian campaign, all those whose imagination was struck by fear died of it. The
        surest protection, the most efficacious remedy, was moral courage. He himself, he said, had touched the
        plague-stricken at Jaffa with impunity and had saved many men by deceiving the soldiers for more than two months
        on the nature of the disease. It was not the plague, they were told, but a bubonic fever. Moreover, he had
        discovered that the best way to preserve the army from the disease was to keep it on the march and occupied.

        to
        the minister of the interior, 1807] Mathematics, physics, natural history, medicine, and jurisprudence are
        sciences, because they are made up of facts that can be observed and compared; because the successive
        discoveries
        to which they lead are cumulative, each century adding to the sum, each day enlarging the domain of science;
        because facts, the relationship of facts to one another, and the method of observing and comparing facts are
        matters that can be taught and, consequently, learned.</p>

      <p class="p6">The minister wishes to establish specialized schools of literary studies. If the ideas stated above
        are correct, it is difficult to understand what is meant by a special school of literature. The plan is to teach
        eloquence, to teach poetry...but what can be taught in those fields that a young student has not learned in his
        course of rhetoric?...Creative talent, whether for writing, musical composition, or painting, is an individual
        gift; it is conditioned by special aptitudes whose development may be furthered by special circumstances, by
        social or historical conditions. In creating works of the intellect and of genius, intellect or genius attain
        their highest achievements directly and spontaneously. We have surpassed the Greeks neither in tragedy nor in
        comedy nor in epic poetry, for the Greeks are still our models, whereas each century of progress has advanced
        the
        exact sciences by a few steps, for they are sciences based on facts, observation, and comparison.</p>

        they
        are to the professions they may choose later but have not yet chosen, demand greater maturity. The professor of
        literature entertains his students if he has some wit; he stimulates their interest if he has some skill; but he
        does not expound a single new principle, a single new idea. He establishes no positive rules, and he teaches
        nothing that is not taught in the high schools. As for himself, he will be no wiser after forty years of
        teaching
        than he had been to begin with. He will know the authors more thoroughly, he will be able to appreciate them

        political necessity, but someone is needed who can touch and vibrate to that chord. The principle of political
        necessity is a rich source of strong emotions, a fertile germ of the most dramatic situations, a new fate no
        less
        imperious, no less ineluctable than that of the ancients, whose [artistic] advantages it would recapture. All
        that
        is needed is to bring one’s dramatic characters into conflict with a new set of passions, a new set of
        tendencies,
        under the absolute influence of that potent necessity. Thus everything that is called coup d’état or political
        crime would become a fit subject for a tragedy: honor being mitigated by necessity, a new and sustained kind of
        pathos would result.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Letter, 1806] Fate pursued the family of Atreus, and the heroes were guilty without being criminal.
        They shared in the crimes of the gods. In modern history, this device has no place. The active principle that
        must
        be employed is the nature of things. It is politics which leads to catastrophe without there being any real
        crime.

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1808, reported by Goethe in German] The Emperor came back to the subject of drama and
        made very significant remarks, like a man who was observing the tragic stage with the intentness of a criminal
        judge and who had deeply felt the deviation of the French theater from nature and truth. Thus he also was led to
        criticize the tragedies of fate. “What do they want from fate in our age?” he said. “Politics is fate.”</p>

        [Conversation, early 1800s] As for the French poets, the only one I understand well is your Corneille. There’s a
        man who had a feeling for politics! If he had had the training, he would have been a statesman. I believe I can
        appreciate him better than anybody else, because when I judge his work I exclude all dramatic emotions. For
        instance, not long ago I found the explanation of the dénouement in <span class="t14">Cinna</span> [in which
        Augustus forgives Cinna, who has plotted against his life, and offers him his friendship]. At first, all I saw
        in
        it was a device for a touching fifth act. Moreover, clemency in itself is such a miserably petty
        virtue&mdash;unless it rests on political motives&mdash;that the clemency of Augustus, who is suddenly
        transformed
        into a good-natured prince, appears to me an unworthy end to that fine tragedy. But one day Monvel, playing the
        part in my presence, revealed to me the secret of that grand conception. He said the line, “Let us be friends,
        Cinna,” in so cunning and wily a tone of voice that I understood that his action was merely a tyrant’s feint,
        and
        what had seemed to me a puerile sentiment I now approved as a calculated ruse. This line must always be spoken
        in
        such a manner that among all those who hear it Cinna alone is deceived.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816, related by Las Cases] Great tragedy, the Emperor said, is the school of great
        men....It is not necessary, he asserted, to be a poet in order to appreciate it; it is enough to have a
        knowledge
        of men and things, to have elevated views, and to be a statesman. Warming to the subject, he continued: “Tragedy
        warms the soul, elevates the heart, can and must create heroes. In these respects, perhaps, France owes many of
        her finest deeds to Corneille. Indeed, gentlemen, had he still been living in my time, I would have created him
        a
        prince.”</p>

        that sweetish tone of his, and with his fastidious ideas.”...And while he was at it, he also condemned the
        famous
        campaign plan of Mithridates [in Racine’s tragedy of that name]. “It may be a fine speech,” he said, “but as a
        military conception it lacks good sense.”</p>

        endorse it against its critics]. If there is anything surprising, it is that he allowed it to be performed. In
        my
        opinion it shows piety in such odious colors, and one of its scenes presents so stark, so completely indecent a
        situation, that as far as I am concerned I do not hesitate to say that if the play had been written under my

        I would not have allowed its performance.</p>

        [Conversation, 1816, related by Las Cases] “The <span class="t14">Iliad,”</span> said the Emperor, “is, like
        Genesis and the whole Bible, the symbol and token of its age. In composing it, Homer was poet, orator,
        historian,
        legislator, geographer, theologian: he was the encyclopedist of his era.”</p>

      <p class="p6">...What struck him most, he remarked, was the coarseness of the manners combined with the perfection
        of the ideas. Heroes are shown slaughtering cattle for meat and preparing it with their own hands, while their
        speeches display rare eloquence and a great civilization.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816, related by Las Cases] After dinner, the Emperor resumed the reading of the

        palace, with both men dressed as beggars. The Emperor expressed strong disapproval of this episode. He found it
        wretched, dirty, improper, unworthy of a king.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">“Besides,” he added, “now that I have run out of critical objections, I can guess what still affects
        me. I put myself in Ulysses’ place&mdash;it’s the fear of being beaten up by a ruffian. It is not given to every
        ruler, to every general, to have the strong shoulders of his guards or grenadiers. Not everybody who wants to
        can
        be a porter. Good old Homer takes care of all that by presenting his heroes as so many giants. But things are
        different with us. Where would we be, all of us here,” he said, glancing at each of us, “if we were still living
        in the olden times when a strong arm was the real scepter? There’s Noverraz”&mdash;his valet&mdash;”who is
        serving

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-540"></a><a href="#calibre_link-781"><span class="t16">{203}</span></a>
        [Dictation, 1820] The Second Book of the <span class="t14">Aeneid</span> is considered to be Virgil’s
        masterpiece.
        It deserves this reputation as far as style is concerned, but it is far from deserving it if content is
        considered.</p>

      <p class="p6">That wooden horse may have been a popular tradition, but the tradition is ridiculous and altogether
        unworthy of an epic poem. Nothing like it can be found in the <span class="t14">Iliad,</span> where everything
        is
        in harmony with truth and military practice. Is it possible to assume the Trojans were such imbeciles as not to
        send a fishing boat to the island of Tenedos and not to make sure that the thousand ships of the Greeks had
        really
        left? Besides, from the towers of Ilion the roadstead of Tenedos was in sight. Is it possible to believe that
        Ulysses and the flower of the Greeks were so inept as to lock themselves up in a wooden horse&mdash;that is to
        say, deliver themselves tied hand and foot to their implacable enemies? Supposing the horse contained only a
        hundred warriors; even so its weight must have been enormous, and it is unlikely that it could be transported
        from
        the seashore to the walls of Ilion in a single day, especially since it had to cross two rivers.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">The warriors who are hidden in the wooden horse, to whom Sinon opens the gate, come out only when
        the
        Greek fleet, which has left Tenedos while everybody was asleep and the night was dark, has already disembarked
        the
        army. In other words, this could not have taken place before 1 <span class="t19">A</span>.<span
          class="t19">M</span>.; and indeed, it is only at that hour that the guards fall asleep and Sinon is able to
        open
        the barrier. Thus the entire action of the Second Book on the sack of Troy takes place from 1 <span
          class="t19">A</span>.<span class="t19">M</span>. to sunrise, that is to say, within three or four hours. All
        this is absurd. Troy cannot have been taken, burned, and destroyed in less than a fortnight. There was an army
        in
        Troy. That army did not run away, and so it must have made a stand in each of the palaces. Aeneas, who stayed in
        his father’s palace, in a wood about half a league distant from Troy, is not informed of the capture and burning
        of the city until the apparition of Hector’s ghost. Even if Anchises’ house had been two miles away from the
        city,
        surely the noise and tumult of the city’s capture, the heat of the burning houses at the edge of the city, would
        have waked the men and the animals. Ilion did not fall in a single night, especially not in so short a night.
        Even
        if the army that was supposed to be there for her defense had evacuated her, it was materially impossible for
        the
        Greek army to take possession and to burn the city in less than several days. Aeneas was not the only warrior in
        Ilion, and yet Virgil does not mention anybody else. The many heroes who play so brilliant a part in the <span
          class="t14">Iliad</span> must have done their part, too, each defending one of the city’s quarters.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">If Homer had described the taking of Troy, he would not have treated it like the capture of a fort
        but
        would have allotted it the required time&mdash;at least eight days and nights. Reading the <span
          class="t14">Iliad,</span> one senses in every line that Homer has been to war and that he did not, as the
        commentators assert, spend his life in the schools of Chios. Reading the <span class="t14">Aeneid,</span> one
        senses that this work was written by a schoolmaster who never did a thing in his life. Indeed, it is impossible
        to
        understand what determined Virgil to begin and end the capture, burning, and sack of Troy within a few hours’
        time. In that short interval he even has the Greeks pile up all their loot in central magazines: Anchises’ house
        must have been near Troy, since within these few hours, and despite the fighting, Aeneas makes several trips
        there. It took Scipio seventeen days to burn Carthage, which had been abandoned by its inhabitants. It took
        eleven
        days for Moscow to burn down, though largely built of wood; and to take possession of a city of that size, a
        conquering army needs several days. Troy was a large city, for the Greeks never tried to encircle it, although
        they had a hundred thousand men. When Aeneas returns to Ilion that night, he finds</p>

      <p class="p6">Ulysses keeping guard over the victors’ spoils;</p>

      <p class="p6">There, heaped upon the ground, lay all the wealth of Troy. For that operation alone more than two
        weeks are required, and it is not during the confusion that goes with taking a city by assault that people will
        waste their time piling up treasures in central magazines.</p>

      <p class="p6">Although Napoleon heeded Machiavelli’s well-known advice to be both fox and lion, he did not care to
        be identified with wolves. One day in July, 1816, Tristan de Montholon, the seven-year-old son of one of
        Napoleon’s companions in exile, recited La Fontaine’s fable, “The Wolf and the Lamb,” for the Emperor&mdash;an
        embarrassing choice, especially because the wolf of the fable addresses the lamb as “Sire.” Napoleon’s comment
        follows, as related by Las Cases.</p>

      <p class="p6">The Emperor found the fable much too ironical to be within the reach of a child’s intelligence.<a

        principles and its moral were deficient&mdash;and this was the first time, he remarked, that this thought had
        struck him. It was not true that “might makes right”; and even if ever it were so, then it was an evil, an abuse
        that had to be righted. Therefore, the wolf should have choked on the lamb he was devouring.</p>

        [Conversation, 1800s] Is a statesman made for sensibility? Is he not a completely eccentric being&mdash;always
        alone on the one side, with the world on the other? He must look through the eyeglasses of his politics, though
        he
        must beware lest they either magnify or reduce something. And while scrutinizing the objects of his attention,
        he
        also must take care to pull the strings he holds in his hand. His chariot often is hitched to unequal horses:
        you
        are the judge whether he ought to fritter away his energy to avoid giving offense to certain sentimental
        conventions, so dear to the common run of men! Has he the right to take notice of family ties, of affections, of
        childish social considerations? And look at his situation&mdash;how many separate actions of his general design
        are criticized, although they are certain to contribute to the great end, an end of which not everyone is aware!
        One day these actions will complete the immense creation of a colossus for the admiration of posterity.
        Wretches,
        will you keep back your praise because you are afraid the motion of that great machine might produce on you the
        same effect as did Gulliver on the Lilliputians, when by moving his leg he crushed them? Take courage, be ahead
        of
        your age, enlarge your imaginations, see far into the distance, and you will realize that the great men whom you
        believe to be violent, cruel, and what not are merely politic. They know themselves, they judge themselves
        better
        than you judge them, and if they are really able, they know how to master their passions, for they calculate the
        effects of even these.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1800s] It is for the sake of a remote, indeterminate goal, which they themselves do
        not
        fully apprehend, that men become heroes and that the inspired minority triumphs over the inert masses. Those

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, December 1812] They think I am stern, even hard-hearted. So much the

        since this notion is responsible for the good order that is prevailing, so that there is nothing that needs to
        be
        repressed....Look here, Caulaincourt, I am human. No matter what some people say, I too have entrails, a
        heart&mdash;but the heart of a sovereign. I am not moved by the tears of a duchess, but the sufferings of the
        people touch me.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] Remember that a man, a true man, never hates. His rages and his bad moods never

      <p class="p6">As is well-known, Napoleon made extensive and expert use of secret police and espionage agents. His
        opinion of them, however, was low.</p>

        [Conversation with an officer, Elba, 1814 or 1815] So you think the police foresees and knows everything. The
        police invents more than it discovers.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817] The Paris police is more feared than efficient. There is a great deal of
        charlatanism in it. It is very difficult to know what a person does every day: the mails yield excellent
        information, but I am not sure that the advantages make up for the evil. The French are so peculiar that often
        they write things which they don’t believe, and this leads to errors. By violating the secrecy of the mails one
        acquires wrong biases.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Letter, 1813] Whatever the spies and secret agents say, unless it is something they have seen with
        their own eyes, is nothing; and often, even if they have seen it, it is not much.</p>

        a
        mob, who are ignorant of the effect of firearms, it is the worst possible policy to start out by firing blanks.
        For the populace, hearing a great noise, are a little frightened after the first discharge, but, looking around
        them and seeing nobody killed or wounded, they pluck up their spirits, begin immediately to despise you, become
        twice as insolent, and rush on fearlessly, and it becomes necessary to kill ten times the number that would have
        been killed if ball had been used in the first place. For, with a mob, everything depends on the first
        impression
        made upon it.</p>

        Despite a decidedly sadistic streak, however, Napoleon appears to have acted thus from cold calculation rather
        than impulsive cruelty. Just what he understood by “needless” reprisals is illustrated in the following
        utterance,
        on the unspeakable blood bath that took place in Lyons during the Terror.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817] Collot d’Herbois committed atrocities in Lyons. It is inconceivable how he

        was
        a tall, dry-looking fellow and would give a good idea of Don Quixote. He attached more importance to the cut of
        a

        performed the finest and most spectacular maneuvers, but I soon put a stop to this tomfoolery and taught them
        that
        to fight and to execute dazzling maneuvers and wear splendid uniforms were very different matters. If the French

        have
        been more advantageous for France if, apart from Austria and Prussia, Germany had been divided into three other
        monarchies powerful enough to defend their territory, to have their neutrality respected, and to contain the
        ambitions of Austria, Prussia, and even France; for that power [France], which we assume to have its frontiers
        on
        the Rhine and the Alps, has no interests outside Italy. If the Italian peninsula were monarchic, it would be

        its superstition, which the mistakes of our generals have fanned still further. It is because of his laziness,
        not
        from heroism, that the Spanish peasant prefers the dangers of smuggling and highway robbery to the toil of the

        enough;
        that what force has overthrown only force can restore; that what has been destroyed for lack of unity only unity

      <p class="p6">From there I would have proceeded to regenerate Europe from the south to the north, under the colors
        of republicanism&mdash;for I was First Consul then&mdash;just as I nearly succeeded in doing later, from the
        north
        to the south, under monarchic forms. Both these systems could have served equally well, for they tended toward
        the
        same end, and both would have been put into operation with firmness, moderation, and good faith. How many known
        evils, how many evils as yet unknown this poor Europe of ours would have been spared! There never was a vaster
        project conceived in the interests of civilization with more generous intent or one that came closer to its
        realization. And here is the remarkable thing: the obstacles that made me fail did not come from men; they all
        came from the elements. In the south, the sea has been my undoing; in the north, the burning of Moscow and the
        cold of winter. Thus water, air, and fire, all of Nature, nothing but Nature&mdash;these have been the enemies
        of
        a universal regeneration which Nature herself demanded! The problems of Providence are insoluble.</p>

        intended.
        I meant that you were a nation of merchants, and that all your great riches and your grand resources arose from

        [Austrian] government itself has called to its aid, has nearly extinguished all the love that the Austrian
        subjects felt for their ruler. “We and the French,” say those Germans, “we are the children of the Romans. The
        Russians are the children of the Tartars. We prefer a thousand times such enemies as the French to such allies
        as
        the Russians.” In Vienna, the very name of the Russians brought terror. Those savage hordes are not content with
        pillaging to provide for their subsistence: they plunder, they demolish everything.</p>

        support and assistance I may be able to give Your Majesty I shall give without hidden motives. I feel no
        jealousy
        toward Russia but only concern for her glory, her prosperity, her greatness. Will Your Majesty accept the advice
        of a person who professes sincere and loving devotion to him? Your Majesty needs to push the Swedes farther back
        from his capital. Your Majesty may increase his territory in that direction as far as he wishes; I am ready to
        help Your Majesty with all the means at my disposal.</p>

      <p class="p6">An army of fifty thousand men&mdash;Russians, Frenchmen, and perhaps even Austrians&mdash;marching

        at
        the same time, Your Majesty’s troops could be in Stockholm....</p>

      <p class="p6">Your Majesty and I would prefer the sweetness of peace...but the enemies of the world do not want it
        thus. We must be great despite ourselves. It is the part of wisdom and of politics to do what destiny ordains

        to follow the lead of the irresistable march of events....In these few lines I am expressing my whole mind to
        Your
        Majesty....Let us acknowledge that the epoch of great events and great changes has come.</p>

      <p class="p6">Alexander showed little eagerness for the personal interview for which Napoleon was pressing. The
        following letter shows the first clouds.</p>

      <p class="p6">[To Caulaincourt, French ambassador in St. Petersburg, May 31, 1808] It seems to me that you are not
        explaining my reasons sufficiently. I wanted the meeting in order to settle our affairs with Russia. The
        Russians
        did not want the interview, since they wanted to make conditions first, that is, unless I accepted all the
        propositions made by Count Romantsov. But it was precisely in order to negotiate these points that I wanted a
        meeting. I shall be available from June 20, but I want an interview without prior conditions. More than that: I
        want the Russians to acknowledge first that I do not adopt the bases proposed by Count Romantsov, which are too
        unfavorable to me. I told Emperor Alexander, “Reconcile the interests of the two empires.” Now, to reconcile the
        interests of the two empires can hardly mean that one of them should sacrifice its interests to the other and
        even
        endanger its independence. Besides, a clash would then become inevitable, for if Russia had an outlet on the
        Dardanelles, she would be at the gates of Toulon, Naples, and Corfu. Thus you must make it clear that Russia
        wants
        much too much and that France cannot agree to such an arrangement, that this is a difficult problem to solve,
        which is the very reason why I tried to come to an understanding at a conference. At bottom, the question is
        always this: Who shall have Constantinople?</p>

      <p class="p6">At the same time, be it noted, Napoleon made protestations of eternal friendship to the emperor of
        Turkey, at whose ungrateful defection in 1812 he was as much incensed as at that of Sweden. The much-desired
        conference took place at Erfurt in 1808 and yielded no real results. Tension between France and Russia increased
        over the years over various pretexts, and events took a course made familiar since then by monotonous
        repetition.

        [Conversation, 1816, related by Las Cases] The Emperor spoke at length about Asia&mdash;the political position
        of
        Russia; the ease with which she might undertake an operation directed at India or even China; the uneasiness
        this
        must cause in England; how many troops Russia would require; the point of departure and the route of the troops;
        the mineral wealth Russia would gain; etc....</p>

      <p class="p6">From there the Emperor passed to what he called the admirable position of Russia over against the
        rest
        of Europe and to the immense mass of Russia’s invasion potential. He described that empire as seated beneath the
        North Pole, resting its back against masses of eternal ice which, when necessary, made it inaccessible. Russia
        could be attacked, he said, only during three or four months of the year, while she disposed of the full year
        against us. Those who attack her find only a wilderness, a landscape either dead or numb, hardship, suffering,
        and
        privations&mdash;while her own peoples are eager to rush toward the delights of the south.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">In the new political organization of Europe, the Emperor said, the fate of that part of the world
        [Russia] depended on the abilities and intentions of a single man. “If Russia gets an emperor who is bold,
        impetuous, capable, in a word a tsar who has some hair on his chest”&mdash;the Emperor used a much more
        energetic
        expression&mdash;”then Europe is his....What is certain is that I, given this situation, would reach Calais
        according to a fixed timetable, and once there I would be the master and arbiter of Europe.” After a few
        moments’
        silence, he added: “Perhaps, my dear Las Cases, you feel tempted to ask me, as the minister of Pyrrhus asked his
        master, ‘And after all that, what is the good of it?’ I answer: to found a new society and to avert great
        misfortunes. Europe is waiting and praying for such a good deed. The old order is finished, the new order is not
        yet firmly established, nor will it be established without protracted and furious convulsions.”</p>

      <p class="p6">The Emperor again fell silent, measuring distances on the map with his calipers and asserting that
        Constantinople was by its situation the center and seat of universal domination, etc.</p>

        March 2, 1807] After the battle of Eylau, the Emperor spent several hours daily on the battlefield....To
        visualize
        the scene one must imagine, within the space of one square league, nine or ten thousand corpses; four or five
        thousand dead horses; rows upon rows of Russian field packs; the remnants of guns and swords; the ground covered
        with cannon balls, shells, and other ammunition; and twenty-four artillery pieces, near which could be seen the
        corpses of the drivers who were killed while trying to move them&mdash;all this sharply outlined on a background
        of snow. A sight such as this should inspire rulers with the love of peace and the hatred of war.</p>

        Josephine, from the Channel coast, 1804] The wind grew very strong last night, and one of our gunboats lost its
        moorings in the roads and was driven against some rocks a league away from Boulogne. I thought that ship and
        crew
        were lost, but we succeeded in saving everything. It was a grand spectacle: the guns firing to give the alarm,
        the
        shore lit up by signal fires, the raging and roaring sea, the whole night spent in the anxiety of saving those
        poor devils or of seeing them perish. The soul was suspended between eternity, the ocean, and the night. At five
        in the morning the weather cleared, all had been rescued, and I went to sleep with the sensation of having had a

        you have four hundred thousand men under arms, which is more than your monarchy ever had. You want to double

        number: we shall follow your example. Soon even the women will have to be conscripted. When things come to this
        point, when all the springs are thus strained, war becomes desirable in order to bring about a release. Thus, in
        the physical world, at the approach of a storm, nature is in a state of tension so painful that the outbreak of
        the storm is desirable because it relaxes the exacerbated nerves and restores heaven and earth to peaceful

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Mack:</span> I beg Your Majesty’s pardon. You have only one hundred forty thousand

        Besides,
        how is it possible to destroy one of the most beautiful cities in the world and the labors of centuries for so
        small an aim? But this is the conduct which has been followed since Smolensk and which has reduced six hundred
        thousand families to beggary. The fire pumps of the city of Moscow had been broken or removed, and part of the
        weapons in the arsenal had been given to criminals who forced us to fire several rounds of artillery on the
        Kremlin in order to dislodge them. Since the Russian army had left Moscow unprotected, common humanity and Your

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-641"></a><a href="#calibre_link-899"><span class="t16">{304}</span></a>
        [Recorded
        by Chaptal, presumably from several conversations] A general’s principal talent consists in knowing the
        mentality
        of the soldier and in winning his confidence. And, in these two respects, the French soldier is more difficult
        to
        lead than any other. He is not a machine to be put in motion but a reasonable being that must be directed.</p>

      <p class="p6">The French soldier possesses bravery of an impatient sort and a sense of honor that makes him
        capable
        of the greatest efforts; but he is in need of severe discipline and he must not be left idle for long.</p>

      <p class="p6">The French soldier loves to argue, because he is intelligent. He is a severe judge of his officers’
        ability and courage. He subjects campaign plans and every single military maneuver to discussion. When he
        approves
        of the operations and respects his superior, there is nothing he cannot do. But it is equally true that, in the
        contrary case, one cannot count on victory.</p>

      <p class="p6">The French soldier is the only European soldier who can fight on an empty stomach. No matter how
        long
        a battle lasts, he forgets to eat so long as there is danger. He is more demanding than any other soldier as
        soon
        as he no longer faces the enemy.</p>

      <p class="p6">The French soldier is indefatigable whenever he pursues a retreating enemy. He is capable of
        marching
        ten to twelve leagues a day and fighting for two or three hours in the evening. I repeatedly took advantage of
        this characteristic during my first Italian campaign.</p>

      <p class="p6">A common French soldier is more interested in winning a battle than is a Russian officer. He
        invariably attributes the major part of a victory to the unit in which he serves.</p>

      <p class="p6">The art of retreating is more difficult with French troops than with Russian ones. A single lost
        battle takes away a Frenchman’s strength and courage, weakens his trust in his superiors, and pushes him to
        insubordination.</p>

      <p class="p6">Russian, Prussian, and German soldiers stay at their posts from a sense of duty; the French soldier,
        from a sense of honor. The former are almost indifferent to defeat, the latter are humiliated by defeat.</p>

        1804] Whatever naval expeditions we have undertaken since I became head of the government have invariably failed
        because the admirals see double and have picked up the notion, I know not where, that one can make war without
        taking any risks.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] Oh, why could not this man [Admiral Suffren, 1726-88] have lived in my time! Or
        why could I not find someone of his mold? I would have made him our Nelson, and things would have taken a
        different turn. But I spent all my time looking for the man the navy needed without ever finding him. There is
        in
        the naval profession a specialized, technical mentality which blocked all my plans. No sooner had I proposed a
        new
        idea than I had Ganteaume and the whole navy on my neck: “Sire, this is impossible.”&mdash;”Why?”&mdash;”Sire,
        the
        winds don’t allow it, and then the doldrums, the currents”&mdash;and with that they stopped me short. How can a
        man argue with people who speak a different language? Time and again, at the Conseil d'état, I would reproach
        them
        with taking unfair advantage of that circumstance. According to them, one has to be born in the navy in order to
        understand anything about it.</p>

        they are like a ship whose masts are out of proportion to the ballast; it is preferable to have much character
        and
        little intellect. Those men whose intellect is mediocre and whose character is in proportion are likely to
        succeed
        in their profession. The base must equal the height. Generals who possessed intellect and character to an
        equally
        high degree were Caesar, Hannibal, Turenne, Prince Eugene [of Savoy], and Frederick [the Great].</p>

      <p class="p6">By “character” Napoleon seems to have understood physical courage as well as perseverance, daring,
        and
        similar qualities. The equilibrium of intellect and character, which he liked to call “squareness,” was one of
        his
        favorite notions, as was his distinction between physical and moral courage.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, December 1815, related by Las Cases] As for moral courage, Napoleon said, he had
        rarely
        encountered the “courage of 2 A.M.”&mdash;that is, the extemporaneous courage which, even in the most sudden
        emergencies, leaves one’s freedom of mind, judgment, and decision completely unaffected. He asserted
        unequivocally
        that he had known himself to possess that 2 A.M. courage to a higher degree than any other man.</p>

        a moment’s thought. He was a little, black-looking man, about an inch shorter than I am, always badly dressed,
        sometimes even ragged, contemptuous of comfort or convenience. When in Egypt, I made him a present of a complete
        field equipage several times, but he always lost it. Wrapped up in a cloak, Desaix threw himself under a gun and
        slept as contentedly as if he were in a palace. For him luxury had no charms. Upright and honest in all his

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-1103"></a><a id="calibre_link-200"></a>THE INTANGIBLES OF THE ART</h2>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-654"></a><a href="#calibre_link-912"><span class="t16">{317}</span></a>
        [Dictation, 1797] The art of war consists, with a numerically inferior army, in always having larger forces than
        the enemy at the point which is to be attacked or defended. But this art can be learned neither from books nor
        from practice: it is an intuitive way of acting which properly constitutes the genius of war.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Letter, 1806] In war nothing can be gained except by calculation. Whatever has not been profoundly
        meditated in all its details is totally ineffectual.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1800s] Military science consists in first calculating all the possibilities
        accurately
        and then in making an almost mathematically exact allowance for accident. It is on this point that one must make
        no mistake; a decimal more or less may alter everything. Now, this apportioning of knowledge and accident can
        take
        place only in the head of a genius, for without it there can be no creation&mdash;and surely the greatest
        improvisation of the human mind is that which gives existence to the non-existent. Accident thus always remains
        a
        mystery to mediocre minds and becomes reality for superior men.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816, reported by Las Cases] Napoleon said that war consists of nothing but accidents
        and that a commander, though he must always adjust himself to general principles, should never overlook anything
        that might enable him to exploit these accidents. The vulgar would call this luck, but in fact it is the
        characteristic of genius.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-655"></a><a href="#calibre_link-913"><span class="t16">{318}</span></a>
        [Dictation, Saint Helena] The art of war is a simple art; everything is in the performance. There is nothing
        vague
        in it; everything in it is common sense; ideology does not enter in.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1818] The art of war is like everything that is beautiful and simple. The simplest
        moves are the best. If Macdonald [one of Napoleon’s generals], instead of doing whatever he did, had asked a
        peasant for the way to Genoa, the peasant would have answered, “Through Bobbio”&mdash;and that would have been a
        superb move.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1818] My great and most distinctive talent is to see everything in a clear light;
        even
        my eloquence is of the kind which sees the core of each question from all its facets at once&mdash;like the
        perpendicular, which is shorter than the diagonal. The great art of winning a battle consists in changing one’s
        line of operations in the middle of the action. This idea is entirely my own and altogether new. It’s what made
        me
        win at Marengo: the enemy attacked my line of operations in order to cut it, but I had changed it and so he
        himself was cut in two.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-656"></a><a href="#calibre_link-914"><span class="t16">{319}</span></a>
        [Conversation, Saint Helena, 1815] The issue of a battle is the result of a single instant, a single thought.
        The
        adversaries come into each other’s presence with various combinations; they mingle; they fight for a length of
        time; the decisive moment appears; a psychological spark makes the decision; and a few reserve troops are enough
        to carry it out.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, Saint Helena] Sometimes a single battle decides everything, and sometimes, too, the
        slightest circumstance decides the issue of a battle.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Dictation, c. 1820] There is a moment in every battle at which the least maneuver is decisive and
        gives superiority, as one drop of water causes overflow.</p>

        [Dictation, Saint Helena] Tactics can be learned from treatises, somewhat like geometry, and so can the various
        military evolutions or the science of the engineer and the gunner; but knowledge of the grand principles of
        warfare can be acquired only through the study of military history and of the battles of the great captains and
        through experience. There are no precise, determinate rules: everything depends on the character that nature has
        bestowed on the general, on his qualities and defects, on the nature of the troops, on the range of the weapons,
        on the season of the year, and on a thousand circumstances which are never twice the same.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Same dictation] The ignorant suspect no difficulties. They want to solve a problem of
        transcendental
        mathematics by means of a second-degree formula. All questions of grand tactics are indeterminate

      <p class="p6">The last two quotations, whose validity remains unaffected by even the most revolutionary changes in
        warfare, come from Napoleon’s notes on a book entitled <span class="t14">Considérations sur l’art de la
          guerre,</span> by General Rogniat (Paris, 1816). Baron Rogniat in his work distinguished dogmatically between
        “invasion warfare” and “methodical warfare”; he asserted that “the reserve army must choose and prepare a line
        of
        defense, which I shall call a ‘base of operations,’ behind which the field army may, in case of reverses, be
        brought up to strength, regrouped, reorganized, and rested, and at which it can stop the enemy with the help of
        contrived and natural obstacles.” These assertions drew particular scorn from Napoleon, as can be seen below.
      </p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-658"></a><a href="#calibre_link-916"><span class="t16">{321}</span></a> Every
        offensive war is invasion warfare; every well-conducted war is methodical warfare. Defensive warfare does not
        exclude attacking, nor does offensive warfare exclude defensive fighting, although its aim is to force the
        frontier and to invade the enemy’s country. The principles of warfare are those which guided the great captains
        whose high deeds history has transmitted to us&mdash;Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Gustavus Adolphus, Turenne,
        Eugene of Savoy, Frederick the Great....The history of their eighty-three campaigns would constitute a complete
        treatise on the art of war; the principles that must be followed in defensive and offensive warfare would flow
        from it as from a common source.</p>

      <p class="p6">Napoleon continues with a survey of the campaigns of these great captains. His judgments have been
        juxtaposed below with contrasting or complementary judgments made at other times. Where no other source is
        indicated, the excerpts are taken from the “Notes on the Art of War.”</p>

      <h3 class="h4"><a id="calibre_link-1105"></a><a id="calibre_link-202"></a>Alexander the Great</h3>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-659"></a><a href="#calibre_link-917"><span class="t16">{322}</span></a> His
        warfare was methodical and deserves the highest praise. Not one of his convoys was interrupted. His armies
        always
        grew as they advanced; they were weakest on the Granicus, at the outset, and they had tripled when they reached
        the Indus, not counting the troops commanded by the governors of the conquered provinces....Alexander deserves
        the
        reputation he has enjoyed in every century and every nation. But what if he had been defeated at Issus, where
        Darius’ army had taken its battle position across his line of retreat, flanked by the mountains on the left and
        the sea on the right, while the Macedonians had the mountains on their right, the sea on their left, and the
        Cilician Gates behind them? What if he had been beaten at Arbela, with the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the desert
        in his rear, with no fortified places and at nine hundred leagues from Macedon? What if he had been defeated by
        Porus and forced back against the Indus?</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817] In order to weigh the merits of generals, the quality of their troops and of
        those of the enemy must be taken into consideration. When one examines the exploits of Agesilaus and the defeat
        of
        Xerxes’ army at Marathon by ten thousand Greeks, it becomes obvious how few were the obstacles that Alexander
        had
        to overcome in defeating his enemies. He gave only a few battles, and his triumphs were due to the order of the
        phalanx rather than his generalship. In all his campaigns it is impossible to discover a single fine maneuver
        worthy of a great general. He was a brave soldier, a grenadier like Léon.<a id="calibre_link-660"></a><a

      <h3 class="h4"><a id="calibre_link-1106"></a><a id="calibre_link-203"></a>Hannibal</h3>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-661"></a><a href="#calibre_link-919"><span class="t16">{324}</span></a> In 218
        B.C., Hannibal left Carthagena, passed the Ebro and the Pyrenees (which until then had been unknown to the
        Carthaginians), crossed the Rhône and the Cottian Alps, and, in his first campaign, gained a foothold amidst the
        Cisalpine Gauls, who...had never yet been subjugated. For this march of four hundred leagues, he took five
        months.
        He did not leave a single garrison in his rear, or a supply depot, and he kept no communications with either
        Spain
        or Carthage, with which he communicated only after the battle of Lake Trasimene. No vaster or grander plan was
        ever carried out by man....Yet this war of offense was methodical. The Cisalpine Gauls of Milan and Bologna
        became
        Carthaginians for his purposes. If he had left garrisons and depots behind him, he would have weakened his army
        and compromised his chances of success; he would have been vulnerable from every side. In 217, he crossed the
        Apennines, defeated the Roman army on Lake Trasimene, converged on Rome, and led his army to the Adriatic coast
        whence, for the first time, he communicated with Carthage. In 216, eighty thousand Romans attacked him; he
        routed
        them at Cannae. Had he marched on, he would have reached Rome in six days and Carthage would have been mistress
        of
        the world! However, that victory [Cannae] had immeasurable consequences: Capua opened its gates; a large number
        of
        Greek colonies and many towns of southern Italy joined the victor and abandoned the cause of Rome. It was
        Hannibal’s principle to keep his forces united and to garrison but one single fortress, which he kept for
        himself
        in order to lock up his hostages, his large engines of war, his important prisoners, and his sick, while
        trusting
        the maintenance of his communications to the good faith of his allies. He maintained himself in Italy for
        fifteen
        years without receiving any reinforcements from Carthage and evacuated her only when his government ordered him
        to
        hasten to the defense of his fatherland. Luck betrayed him at Zama. Carthage ceased to exist. But what if he had
        been beaten on the Trebbia, at Lake Trasimene, at Cannae&mdash;what worse fate could have happened to
        him?...Defeated at the very gates of his capital, he was unable to save his army from total destruction. And if
        he
        had left one half or even only one third of his army at his first and second bases of operations, would he have
        been victorious on the Trebbia, at Cannae, at Trasimene? No. All would have been lost, even his reserves, and
        history would have ignored him.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Later passage, same dictation] As for Hannibal’s crossing of the Alps, its difficulty has been
        exaggerated; only the elephants could cause him any trouble. Beginning in 600 B.C., or four centuries before
        Hannibal, the Gauls used to pass the Alps and invade Italy.</p>

        principles were the same as Alexander’s and Hannibal’s: to keep his forces united; to be vulnerable at no point,
        to strike speedily at critical points; to rely on moral factors, such as his reputation and the fear he
        inspired,
        as well as on political means in order to insure the loyalty of his allies and the submissiveness of the
        conquered
        nations; to make use of every possible opportunity of increasing his chances of victory on the battlefield and,
        in
        order to accomplish this, to unite all his troops.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817] Caesar...had to fight courageous enemies. He took great risks in the adventures
        into which he was pushed by his boldness; his genius got him out of his difficulties. His battles in the Civil
        War&mdash;that’s what I call real battles, taking into account the enemies he had to fight as well as the
        qualities of their generals. He was a man whose genius and boldness were equally great.</p>

        Adolphus crossed the Baltic, seized the island of Rügen and Pomerania, and led his men to the Vistula, the
        Rhine,
        and the Danube. He fought two battles. Victorious at Leipzig, he also won at Lützen; but there he met his death.
        So brief a military career has left lasting memories because of the boldness and speed of his movements and the
        organization and intrepidity of his troops. Gustavus Adolphus acted on the same principles as Alexander,
        Hannibal,
        and Caesar.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817] There is your great Gustavus! In eighteen months, he wins one battle, loses
        another, and is killed in the third. A cheaply earned reputation if ever there was one!...Tilly and Wallenstein
        were better generals than Gustavus Adolphus. There is not a single scientific maneuver this prince is known to
        have made. He evacuated Bavaria because Tilly outmaneuvered him, and he allowed Magdeburg to be taken right
        under
        his eyes. A fine reputation!</p>

        Turenne’s
        maneuvers and marches in the campaigns of 1646, 1648, 1672, and 1673 were based on the same principles as those
        of
        Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, and Gustavus Adolphus....The boldness and length of these marches astonished
        France,
        and, until they were justified by success, they were the target for the criticism of mediocre men. If he had
        built
        bases every thirty leagues, if he had left reserve armies behind, they would have been defeated separately.</p>

      <p class="p6">Prince Eugene, in his campaign of 1706, started from Trent, followed the left bank of the Adige,
        crossed that river before the French did, followed the Po upstream along the left bank, crossed the Tanaro
        before
        the duke of Orléans, and joined the duke of Savoy below Turin. There he turned all the lines of the French,
        attacked their right between the Sesia and the Dora, and forced his passage through them. This audacious march
        was
        crowned by the most brilliant success. What would that great man have said if it had been suggested to him that
        he
        establish four bases and twelve fortresses and leave the larger part of his army behind in them&mdash;he who,
        with
        only thirty thousand men, paid no attention to the army of the duke of Orléans, which was on his flank and rear?

      <h3 class="h4"><a id="calibre_link-1110"></a><a id="calibre_link-207"></a>Frederick the Great</h3>

      <p class="p6">On Frederick the Great, Napoleon had little of interest to say in his “Notes on the Art of War,” but
        he dictated a whole separate volume on Frederick’s campaigns, from which the following excerpt is taken.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-665"></a><a href="#calibre_link-923"><span class="t16">{328}</span></a>
        Everything
        proves that [in the Seven Years War] Frederick could not have withstood France, Austria, and Russia throughout a
        campaign if these powers had cooperated in good faith; nor could he have conducted two campaigns against Austria
        and Russia if the Russian cabinet had allowed its armies to occupy winter quarters in the theater of operations.
        Thus the miraculous element in the Seven Years War evaporates. But Frederick’s actual accomplishments justify
        the
        reputation which the Prussian army enjoyed through the latter half of the eighteenth century and enhance rather
        than diminish Frederick’s great military fame.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Earlier passage in the same commentary on Frederick] The battle of Leuthen is a masterpiece of
        operations, maneuvers, and resolution. By itself, it would be enough to immortalize Frederick and to place him
        among the greatest generals.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817] What distinguishes Frederick most is not the cleverness of his moves but his
        boldness.</p>

      <h3 class="h4"><a id="calibre_link-1111"></a><a id="calibre_link-208"></a>Charles XII of Sweden</h3>

      <p class="p6">Whether criticized or admired, boldness is the common quality singled out by Napoleon in the seven
        great generals whom he cites as examples. Probably none of them was as bold as Charles XII, for whom Napoleon
        had
        nothing but criticism. Since Napoleon fell into the same traps as Charles (but with Charles’s warning example
        before his eyes), he was particularly anxious to deny the existence of a parallel. The following excerpt comes
        from the “Notes on the Art of War.”</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-666"></a><a href="#calibre_link-924"><span class="t16">{329}</span></a> 1.
        Charles
        XII traversed five hundred leagues of enemy territory [in Russia]. 2. He lost his line of operations the day
        after
        he left Smolensk. 3. He remained a whole year without receiving news from Stockholm. 4. He had no reserve army.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">1. Napoleon went only one hundred leagues into enemy territory. 2. He always maintained his line of
        operations. 3. He daily received news and supplies from France. 4. He kept three quarters of his army in reserve
        between the Vistula and Moscow. Moreover, Charles made war with forty thousand men, Napoleon with four hundred
        thousand. Their two respective operations were diametrically opposed: as the one followed the rules and
        calculated
        the means in proportion to the end, so the other miscalculated both end and means.</p>

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-1112"></a><a id="calibre_link-209"></a>ON PLANNING A CAMPAIGN</h2>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-667"></a><a href="#calibre_link-925"><span class="t16">{330}</span></a>
        [Conversation, 1799] There is no man more pusillanimous than I when I am planning a campaign. I purposely
        exaggerate all the dangers and all the calamities that the circumstances make possible. I am in a thoroughly
        painful state of agitation. This does not keep me from looking quite serene in front of my entourage; I am like
        an
        unmarried girl laboring with child. Once I have made up my mind, everything is forgotten except what leads to
        success.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-668"></a><a href="#calibre_link-926"><span class="t16">{331}</span></a>
        [Dictation, 1797, on the Carinthian campaign of 1797] It is said and repeated everywhere that the Army of Italy
        was lost [when Napoleon signed the armistice at Leoben] and that, if Bonaparte had not by good fortune made
        peace,
        he would have joined the ranks of the prisoners at Olmütz.</p>

      <p class="p6">Bonaparte entered Germany from three sides at the same time&mdash;through the Tyrol, Carinthia, and
        Carniola. In thus dividing his forces, he had no fear of being too weak everywhere, for the enemy forces
        themselves were thus placed. Besides, he was obliged to attack in that manner in order to leave his retreat open
        and to make sure that he could cover his magazines and depots.</p>

      <p class="p6">But when the enemy was fleeing on all sides and had abandoned his magazines, twenty-four thousand
        prisoners, and sixty artillery pieces to Bonaparte, who had taken possession of Trieste, Gorizia, Klagenfurt,
        and
        Bressanone, then Bonaparte felt that he himself was in turn open to attack. The enemy, having retreated far
        beyond
        the mountains, was capable of reuniting his forces, of masking his movements, of falling on Bonaparte’s several
        divisions, and of routing them one by one. Bonaparte carefully refrained from having his divisions in the Tyrol
        march on Innsbruck; instead, he made them come into Carinthia. He also ordered into Carinthia the division that
        was stationed in Carniola&mdash;instead of sending it to Istria, as a less able general might have
        done&mdash;and
        he garrisoned Klagenfurt and made it his principal depot.</p>

      <p class="p6">By this means, instead of three lines of communication he had only one; instead of being obliged to
        keep in check the traditionally unfriendly and turbulent Tyrolese, he evacuated the Tyrol and had nothing more
        to
        fear on their account; and instead of holding a front line eighty leagues long, he concentrated the Army of
        Italy
        in one single point which threatened Vienna, Hungary, and Bavaria at the same time.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-669"></a><a href="#calibre_link-927"><span class="t16">{332}</span></a>
        [Comments
        dictated in 1806 on Kutuzov’s official report on the Moravian campaign of 1805] The battle of Austerlitz itself
        is
        merely the outcome of the plan of the Moravian campaign. In an art as difficult as the art of war, the scheme of
        a
        battle is often implicit in the scheme of the campaign. Only the most experienced military men will understand
        this. Two weeks before the battle, when the Emperor returned from his reconnaissance trip to Wischau, the
        persons
        of his entourage heard him say, concerning the heights on which the postal relay and the ponds are situated: “Be
        sure to reconnoiter all these heights thoroughly; you will fight a battle here before two months.” At first they
        paid no attention to his words, but on the day after the battle they remembered them.</p>

      <p class="p6">In planning the Moravian campaign, the Emperor understood that the Russians, since they lacked a
        first-rate general, would think that the line of retreat of the French army was anchored on Vienna.
        Consequently,
        they had to attach great importance to cutting the Vienna road, whereas in fact, throughout the whole Moravian
        campaign, the French line of retreat was never intended to bear on Vienna. This single circumstance falsified
        all
        the enemy’s calculations and was bound to make him decide on movements which led to his annihilation.</p>

      <h2 class="h1"><a id="calibre_link-1113"></a><a id="calibre_link-210"></a>RESOLUTION LOST AND RECOVERED</h2>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-670"></a><a href="#calibre_link-928"><span class="t16">{333}</span></a> [“Note
        on
        the general state of my affairs,” Dresden, August 30, 1813] There are two plans that I can adopt. The first
        would
        be to march on Prague, taking advantage of my successes against Austria. But, in the first place, I am no longer
        able to reach Prague before the enemy, and Prague being strongly fortified, I would then be unable to take it.
        Bohemia might rise against me, and I would be in a difficult spot. In the second place, the enemy forces in
        Silesia would attack my own forces there, and this would compromise my position in Prague. It is true that that
        army [i.e., the French forces in Silesia] could retreat to Dresden and base their defense on it. In the third
        place, given this state of affairs, Oudinot’s army as well as that of the prince of Eckmühl [Davout] would have
        to
        remain on the defensive [in North Germany], and by mid-October I would have lost nine thousand men at Stettin. I
        would then be occupying the Elbe line from Prague to the Baltic Sea. That line is too long: if it were
        penetrated
        at any point, the 32d military district [i.e., the German territories annexed to France] would be open to
        attack,
        and I would be obliged to turn back in order to defend the most vulnerable part of my Empire. The Russians have
        nothing to fear either for their own country or for Poland; they would reinforce their army between the Oder and
        the Elbe, in Mecklenburg and Bohemia.</p>

      <p class="p6">Thus the project of marching on Prague has disadvantages. 1. The probability of my being able to
        take
        Prague is not strong enough to amount to certainty. 2. I would be placed, with the major part of my forces, in
        an
        altogether different military situation; and, as for my person, I would be placed at one extremity of my front.
        Thus I would be unable to reach any threatened point in time; my lieutenants would make mistakes; and the war
        would be carried into the area between the Elbe and the Rhine, which is what the enemy wants. 3. I would lose my
        fortresses on the Oder and could not reach Danzig.</p>

      <p class="p6">If, on the contrary, I march on Berlin, I immediately achieve a major result: I protect my front
        from
        Hamburg to Dresden; I am at the center [of the front]; I relieve Stettin and Küstrin; I am able to effect
        without
        delay a separation of the Russian and the Austrian forces; I can easily keep myself supplied in Berlin at this
        time of the year; I shall be supplied with potatoes, with the great resources of that city, by way of the
        canals,
        etc.; and I shall keep the war in the area in which it has been fought thus far. In my warfare with Austria, my
        only disadvantage would be the sacrifice of one hundred twenty thousand men, who would defend the line between
        Dresden and Hof; this defense would be a useful training for these raw troops. I can derive political advantage
        vis-à-vis Austria by sparing Bohemia. With the Austrians immobilized by the presence of one hundred twenty
        thousand men on its borders, I shall be threatening Prague without having to go there. The Prussians will not
        care
        to stay in Bohemia once their capital has been taken, and even the Russians will fear to lose Poland when they
        see
        the Polish forces [under Napoleon] massed on the Oder. One of two things must then happen. The Russians and the
        Prussian forces in Bohemia will force Austria to resume the offensive and to return to Dresden. This will take
        them at least two weeks. By that time I have taken Berlin, relieved Stettin, destroyed the Prussian fieldworks,
        and disorganized the <span class="t14">Landwehr.</span> Then, if Austria starts acting foolish again, I return
        to
        Dresden with my whole reunited army: great events, a great battle, would end both the campaign and the war.</p>

      <p class="p6">Finally, in my present position, any plan in which I am not personally at the center is
        inadmissible.
        Any plan that keeps me away [from the scene of operations] would result in a conventional kind of warfare in
        which
        the enemy’s superior cavalry, numbers, and even generals would lead me to total ruin.</p>

      <p class="p6">Napoleon’s reasoning, though it miscarried, would seem worthy of his reputation; yet the very fact
        that he resorted to dictation in order to think it out was a sign of his irresolution. It was only in 1814, when
        French soil was invaded, that Napoleon roused himself to an activity that bordered on the superhuman, as a flame
        flares highest just before its death.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-671"></a><a href="#calibre_link-929"><span class="t16">{334}</span></a> [Letter
        to
        Marshal Augereau, commandant of Lyons, dictated at Nogent, February 21, 1814] My Cousin, the minister of war has
        shown me the letter you wrote him on the 16<span class="t17">th</span>. That letter has caused me acute
        suffering.
        What! Six hours after receiving the first reinforcements from Spain you had not yet taken the field? Six hours’
        rest was enough for them. I have won the engagement at Nangis with a brigade of dragoons that came from Spain
        and
        had not unbridled their horses since Bayonne. You say that the six battalions from the Nîmes district are
        lacking
        clothes and equipment and are untrained. What a poor excuse, Augereau! I have annihilated eighty thousand enemy
        troops with battalions made up of raw recruits who had no knapsacks and were poorly clad. You say the militia is
        pitiful: I have four thousand of them here, from Angers and Brittany, wearing round hats and wooden shoes,
        without
        cartridge pouches, but with good rifles. I have used them to good advantage. There is no money, you continue:
        and
        where do you think you can get money from? You cannot get any money until we have wrested our tax receipts from
        the enemy’s hands. You lack carriages: take them where you can find them. You have no magazines: don’t be
        ridiculous. I command you to leave within twelve hours from the time you receive this letter and to take the
        field. If you are still the old Augereau of Castiglione, keep your command. If your sixty years weigh too heavy
        upon you, resign your command and hand it to the senior general officer on your staff. The fatherland is
        threatened and in danger. Only boldness and good will can save it, not futile temporizing. You must have a core
        of
        more than six thousand elite troops. I have not that many, but nevertheless I have destroyed three armies, taken
        forty thousand prisoners and two hundred cannon, and thrice saved the capital. From all sides the enemy is
        fleeing
        toward Troyes. Be the first on the firing line! It no longer is a question of making war as we did in the last
        few
        years: we must put our boots on again along with our resolution of 1793! When the French soldier sees your white
        plumes at the outposts, when he sees that you are the first to expose yourself to the fire, you can make him do
        anything you like.</p>

        WATERLOO</h2>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-672"></a><a href="#calibre_link-930"><span class="t16">{335}</span></a>
        [Dictation, Saint Helena] 1. The English commander [Wellington] accepted battle at Waterloo on June 18. His
        decision was contrary to his nation’s best interests and to the strategy adopted by the Allies; it violated
        every
        rule of warfare. It was against the interest of England&mdash;who needs all her available manpower for her
        armies
        in India, for her American colonies, and for her other establishments&mdash;to accept with a light heart the
        risk
        of a murderous battle, which might have cost her the only army she had or, at least, the flower of her men. The
        Allied strategy was to act in a mass and not to engage in separate battles. Nothing was further from their
        interests and their plan than to risk the issue of their cause in a hazardous battle in which the opposing
        forces
        were approximately equal and all the probabilities were against them. If the Anglo-Dutch army had been destroyed
        at Waterloo, what good would all the armies that were getting ready to cross the Rhine, the Alps, and the
        Pyrenees
        have done the Allies?</p>

      <p class="p6">2. When he made the decision to await battle in front of the Soigne Forest, the English general
        counted on the cooperation of the Prussians; but their junction could not take place before the afternoon. Thus
        he
        was exposed alone from 4 A.M. to 4 P.M., that is, for twelve hours. A battle ordinarily lasts six hours. Thus
        that
        cooperation was illusory.</p>

      <p class="p6">3. However, what is more, since he counted on the cooperation of the Prussians, he must have
        supposed
        that he was facing the entire French army. Thus he had the notion that with ninety thousand men of various
        nationalities he could defend his battlefield for twelve hours against one hundred four thousand Frenchmen.</p>

      <p class="p6">This calculation was obviously in error. He could not have held out for three hours. All would have
        been over by 8 A.M., and the Prussians would have made their appearance only to be outflanked. In a single day
        two
        armies would have been destroyed.</p>

      <p class="p6">4. If he figured that, in accord with the rules of warfare, one part of the French army had followed
        the Prussian army [after the Prussian defeat at Ligny], then it must have been obvious to him that he could have
        no assistance whatever from the Prussians. Indeed, the Prussians had been routed at Ligny; they had lost
        twenty-five to thirty thousand men on the battlefield; twenty thousand more of their troops were scattered; and
        they were being pursued by thirty-five to forty thousand victorious Frenchmen: the Prussians were not in a
        position to spare any men and considered themselves barely strong enough to remain in the field. Things being
        thus, the Anglo-Dutch army, without any assistance, would have had to resist the efforts of sixty-two thousand
        Frenchmen through the whole day of June 18&mdash;and every Englishman admits that there could be no doubt about
        the outcome and that Wellington’s army was not in a state to absorb the shock of the imperial army for six
        hours.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">5. During the whole night of June 17-18 the weather was horrible, and the terrain was impracticable
        until 9 A.M. This loss of five hours (from dawn to 9 A.M.) was entirely in the enemy’s favor. But could the
        enemy
        commander let the issue of such a struggle depend on the weather that would prevail on the night of June 17-18?
        Marshal Grouchy, with thirty-four thousand men and eight hundred guns, discovered the secret&mdash;which seemed
        beyond human capability&mdash;of being, throughout the day of June 17, throughout the morning of June 18,
        neither
        on the battlefield of Mont-Saint-Jean nor on his way to Wavre. But had the English commander received the
        marshal’s assurance that he would get lost in so mysterious a manner? The conduct of Marshal Grouchy, who from
        the
        age of twenty had so often distinguished himself at the head of the cavalry, was as unforeseeable as if his army
        had been surprised by an earthquake and swallowed up.</p>

      <p class="p6">6. If Marshal Grouchy had been on the battlefield of Mont-Saint-Jean&mdash;as the English and the
        Prussian commanders [Wellington and Blücher] thought that he was throughout the night of June 18&mdash;and if
        the
        weather had permitted the French army to maneuver on its terrain beginning at 4 A.M., the Anglo-Dutch army would
        have been cut up and scattered before 7 A.M.; it would have lost everything. And if the weather had kept the
        battle from beginning until 10 A.M., the fate of the Anglo-Dutch army would have been sealed by 1 P.M.; its
        remnants would have been thrown back beyond the forest or in the direction of Hal. There would have been ample
        time in the evening to go to meet Marshal Blücher and to inflict a similar fate on him. If Marshal Grouchy had
        camped before Wavre on the evening of the 17<span class="t17">th</span>, the Prussian army would not have
        detached
        any forces to come to the help of the British, who would have been completely routed by the sixty-two thousand
        Frenchmen opposing them.</p>

      <p class="p6">7. The position of Mont-Saint-Jean was ill-chosen [by Wellington], The first rule for choosing a
        battlefield is not to have any defiles at one’s rear. During the battle, the English general was unable to take
        advantage of his numerous cavalry. He did not realize that he would necessarily be attacked on his left; he
        thought the attack would come from the right. Despite the diversion effected in his favor by the thirty thousand
        Prussians under General Bülow, he would have ordered a retreat twice during that day if a retreat had been
        practicable. Thus the fact&mdash;such is the bizarre course of human events!&mdash;that the poor choice of his
        battlefield made all retreat impossible was the cause of his victory.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1817, reported in English] As a general, Wellington’s plan did not show talent. He
        certainly displayed great courage and obstinacy, but a little must be taken away even from that when you
        consider
        that he had no means of retreat....First, to the firmness and bravery of his troops, for the English fought with
        the greatest obstinacy and courage, he is principally indebted for the victory, and not to his own conduct as a
        general; and next, to the arrival of Blücher, to whom the victory is more to be attributed than to Wellington,
        and
        more credit due as a general&mdash;because he, though beaten the day before, assembled his troops and brought
        them
        into action in the evening. I believe, however, that Wellington is a man of great firmness.</p>

        [Conversation, 1816] I shall be credited with great profundity and subtlety in things which perhaps were
        simplicity itself. Projects will be ascribed to me which were never mine. People will wonder whether or not I
        really aimed at universal monarchy. It will be argued at length whether my absolute authority and my arbitrary
        actions were the effects of my character or of my calculations; whether they were caused by my inclination or by
        force of circumstance; whether I waged constant warfare to indulge my personal taste or whether I was pushed
        into
        it against my will; whether my immense ambition, for which I have been blamed so much, was spurred by lust for
        power, or thirst for glory, or the necessity of establishing order, or love of general welfare&mdash;for it
        deserves to be examined from several angles. Arguments will rage concerning the motives that led me in the
        catastrophic affair of the due d’Enghien<a id="calibre_link-674"></a><a href="#calibre_link-821"><span
            class="t16">{337}</span></a> and on innumerable other occasions. Many matters that were altogether natural
        and
        straightforward will be subtly distorted. It is not up to me to deal specifically with these questions: I would
        be
        pleading, and this I despise....Yet by how much misinformation will [historians] be assailed, ranging from the
        lies and inventions of timeservers...to the revelations, “documentation,” and assertions made even by my
        ministers, decent people though they were, who will reveal not so much what actually took place as what they
        thought was taking place! For is there a single one among them who knew my whole mind? Their personal share
        consisted, most of the time, merely of some elements of the vast whole, of which they were unaware. Thus they
        have
        seen only their own facet of the prism&mdash;and, at that, how unlikely they are to have seen even that facet
        correctly! Have they seen all of it? Was it not in its turn cut into fragments? And yet there is not one who,
        according to his own insight, would not present as my true policy the fantastic product of his own reasonings:
        hence, once more, the agreed-upon fiction called history. And it cannot be otherwise. It is true that, being
        several, they are unlikely to be in agreement. Besides, as far as their positive assertions go, they will prove
        themselves cleverer than I, for I often would have found it very difficult to assert with any degree of truth
        what
        was my whole and real intention.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] I may have had many projects, but I never was free to carry out any of them. It
        did me little good to be holding the helm; no matter how strong my hands, the sudden and numerous waves were
        stronger still, and I was wise enough to yield to them rather than resist them obstinately and make the ship
        founder. Thus I never was truly my own master but was always ruled by circumstances. This is so true that when,
        at
        the beginning of my reign, during the Consulate, my true friends and most enthusiastic champions asked me, with
        the best intentions and for their own guidance, where I was heading, I always answered that I had not the least
        idea. This astonished and possibly annoyed them, and yet I was telling them the truth....The fact was that I was
        not master of my actions, because I was not so insane as to attempt to bend events to conform to my policies. On
        the contrary, I bent my policies to accord with the unforeseen shape of the events, and this is what often gave
        me
        the appearance of fickleness and inconsistency, of which I have been accused at times; but were these
        accusations
        fair?</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-675"></a><a href="#calibre_link-822"><span class="t16">{338}</span></a>
        [Conversation, after 1811] France does not know my position well, and that is why she completely misjudges most
        of
        my acts. Five or six families are sharing the thrones of Europe, and they are pained to see a Corsican taking a
        seat on one of them. I cannot keep my place except by using force. I cannot accustom them to look upon me as an
        equal except by keeping them under my yoke. As soon as I cease to be feared, my Empire is destroyed. Thus I must
        repress whatever they undertake. I cannot let them threaten me and not strike back. What would be an indifferent
        matter to a king of an old dynasty is very serious to me. I shall persist in this attitude so long as I live,
        and
        if my son does not become a great warrior, if he does not resemble me, he will have to come down from the throne
        to which I shall have raised him&mdash;for it takes more than one man to consolidate a monarchy. Louis XIV,
        despite all his earlier victories, would have lost his crown at the end of his life if he had not been the heir
        of
        a long line of kings. Among the anciently established sovereigns, war aims never go beyond possession of a
        province or a fortress. With me, the stake is always my existence and that of the whole Empire.</p>

      <p class="p6">In domestic matters, my position is entirely different from that of the long-established sovereigns.
        They can live indolently in their palaces; they can abandon themselves shamelessly to all the debauches of
        riotous
        living. Nobody challenges their legitimate rights; nobody dreams of replacing them; nobody accuses them of
        ingratitude, since nobody has helped them to attain the throne. As for me, everything is different: there is no
        general but believes he has the same rights to the throne as I. There is no influential man who doesn’t give
        himself the credit for having guided my conduct on the Eighteenth Brumaire. Consequently, I must be very stern
        toward those people. If I were familiar with them, they would soon share my power and the public treasury. They
        don’t like me&mdash;but they fear me, and that’s good enough for me. I admit them into the army, I give them
        commands&mdash;but I also keep an eye on them. They wanted to escape my yoke; they wanted to federalize France.
        One word from me was enough to stifle their plot. So long as I live, they will never be dangerous. If I suffered
        a
        defeat, they would be the first to desert me.</p>

      <p class="p6">At home as abroad, I reign only through the fear I inspire. If I renounced this system, I would be
        dethroned before long. This is my position, and these are the motives that guide me.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, date uncertain] My power is dependent on my glory, and my glory on my victories. My
        power would fall if I did not base it on still more glory and still more victories. Conquest made me what I am;
        conquest alone can keep me there.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-676"></a><a href="#calibre_link-823"><span class="t16">{339}</span></a> [Letter
        to
        Talleyrand, 1797] We hold the balance of Europe; we shall make it tip as we choose. And, if such be the decree
        of
        destiny, I do not even consider it an impossibility that within a few years we may attain such great results as
        can be glimpsed by an ardent and enthusiastic imagination and as only an extremely cool-headed, steadfast, and
        rational man can carry out.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, c. 1802, reported by Bourrienne] In his vast manner of looking at the world, Napoleon
        saw only two great States&mdash;the Orient and the Occident. ‘What does it matter,” he used to say, “whether two
        nations are separated by rivers or mountains, or that they speak different idioms? Except for a few shadings,
        France, Spain, England, Italy, and Germany have the same traditions, the same religion, the same costume. A man
        in
        these countries can marry only one wife, and there are no slaves. These are the great divisions that separate
        the
        civilized inhabitants of the globe into two halves. Except for Turkey, Europe is but one province of the world.
        When we make war, we make civil war.”</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1805] I have a few ideas that aren’t ripe yet, but they are far-reaching. There is
        not
        enough sameness among the nations of Europe. European society needs a regeneration. There must be a superior
        power
        which dominates all the other powers, with enough authority to force them to live in harmony with one
        another&mdash;and France is best placed for that purpose.</p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816] One of my great conceptions was the agglomeration, the concentration, of those
        geographic-national entities which revolutions and politics have dissolved or broken up. Thus there are in
        Europe&mdash;though scattered&mdash;more than thirty million Frenchmen, fifteen million Spaniards, fifteen
        million
        Italians, thirty million Germans. I should have liked to make out of each of these peoples one single and
        uniform
        national body....</p>

      <p class="p6">After this summary process of simplification, it would have been possible to pursue the chimera of
        the
        <span class="t14">beau idéal</span> of civilization, for in this new order of things there was an improved
        chance
        of creating everywhere uniform codes, principles, opinions, feelings, outlooks, and interests. Then, perhaps,
        with
        the help of the universal spread of education, it would have been permissible to dream of applying the American
        constitution to the great European family.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816, reported by Las Cases] “I, too, would have had my Congress [of Vienna] and my
        Holy Alliance [if the Russian campaign had succeeded]. They have stolen these ideas from me. In such a congress
        of
        sovereigns we would have settled our interests among ourselves without asking the peoples.</p>

      <p class="p6">The cause of the century had been won, the Revolution accomplished. All that remained to be done was
        reconcile it with those institutions which it had not destroyed. Now, that achievement was my mission. I had
        prepared it long in advance, perhaps at the cost of my popularity. No matter, I would have become the ark of the
        old and the new covenant, the natural mediator between the old and the new order of things. I believed in the
        principles and I enjoyed the trust of the one, and I identified myself with the other: I belonged to both, and I
        would have assigned each its own share conscientiously.”...</p>

      <p class="p6">Napoleon then reviewed the measures he would have proposed for the prosperity, interests, and
        welfare
        of the association of European states. He would have desired identical principles and systems everywhere&mdash;a
        European code; a European supreme court to which all cases could be appealed...; a uniform currency issued under
        various coinages; uniform weights, measures, laws, etc., etc.</p>

      <p class="p6">“Europe,” he said, “thus would soon have become a truly united nation, and everybody, no matter
        where
        he traveled, would always have been in the common fatherland of all.”</p>

      <p class="p6">He would have insisted on freedom of navigation for all on rivers and on the high seas and asked
        that
        standing armies be reduced to mere guards of the sovereigns....</p>

      <p class="p6">He concluded by saying: “Once back in France, having returned to the bosom of the great, strong,
        magnificent, peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I would have proclaimed that its frontiers were henceforth
        immutable, that all future wars had to be defensive, that any further aggrandizement would be against the
        national
        interest. I would have shared my power with my son; my dictatorship would have ended, and his constitutional
        reign
        would have begun. Paris would have been the capital of the world, and Frenchmen the cynosure of nations.</p>

      <p class="p6">“After that, while my son was going through his royal apprenticeship, I would have spent the idle
        hours of my old age in visiting the remotest corners of my Empire, traveling in leisurely fashion, in company
        with
        the Empress, like a real rustic couple, with our own horses, listening to grievances, righting wrongs, leaving
        monuments and good deeds behind us wherever we went. More dreams, my dear fellow!”</p>

      </p>

      <p class="p6">[Conversation, 1816, related by Las Cases] In his scheme and plans [said the Emperor], military
        conscription, far from obstructing education, would have become an educational tool. Eventually, he said, each
        regiment would have had a school in which all subjects were taught&mdash;elementary and advanced courses, in the
        scientific line as well as in the liberal arts and in simple mechanics. “Nothing would have been easier than to
        put all this into practice,” he remarked. “Once the principle was adopted, it would have been possible for each
        regiment to find all the necessary specialized personnel within its own ranks.”</p>

      <p class="p6">[Same conversation] Then the Emperor passed on to the parish priests, who according to his plans
        were
        to play a most important and useful role. “The better educated they are,” he said, “the less they will be
        inclined
        to abuse their ministry.” Thus he wanted their theological studies to be supplemented by courses in scientific
        farming, elementary medicine, and law. “In that manner,” he said, “by insensible degrees, dogma and controversy,
        which are merely the battle horses and weapons of fools and fanatics, would have become less often heard from
        the
        pulpits, and nothing would have been left but pure morality, which is always beautiful, always eloquent, always
        persuasive, always listened to. And, since men like to display their knowledge, these ministers of a purely
        charitable religion would have preferred to speak to the peasants about their crops, their labors, their fields.
        The priests would have been in a position to assist them with useful legal or medical advice. Everybody would
        have
        gained by it.”</p>

      <p class="p6">[Same conversation] “I wanted to make it a law that only those lawyers and attorneys should receive
        fees who had won their cases. How much litigation would have been prevented by such a measure! For it is quite
        obvious that there is not a lawyer who, after a first look at the case, would not turn it down if it seemed
        doubtful. It need not be feared that a man who earns his living from his work might take on a case for the
        simple
        pleasure of hearing himself talk; yet even if he did, he would harm no one but himself. But with the
        practitioners
        of the law,” the Emperor observed, “the simplest things straight away become complicated. They cited all sorts
        of
        objections and disadvantages, and since I had no time to waste I deferred my plan. But I am convinced to this
        day
        that the idea is brilliant.”</p>

      <p class="p6">[Recollection of Las Cases] I also recall hearing him suggest [at the Conseil d'état] that all
        public
        officials and employees, even the military, should create their own future pension funds. This would be done by
        withholding a small part of their annual salary. He attached great importance to this. “In that manner,” he
        said,
        “everybody’s future security will no longer depend on solicitations and favors: it will be a right, a true form
        of
        property...The objection was made that the salaries, especially those of the military, were too small to admit
        of
        deduction. “Well, in that case, I shall pay the difference,” replied the Emperor. “I shall contribute as much as
        has been withheld.”&mdash;”But what is the good of it, in that case?” it was further objected. “If the
        government
        must make the same expenditure either way, there is no economy. What advantages are there, then?”&mdash;”The
        advantages,” replied the Emperor, “consist in the difference between certainty and uncertainty. The Treasury

        [Conversation, 1816, paraphrased by Las Cases] The Emperor said that, in recent years, France had succeeded in
        producing beet sugar of the same quality and price as cane sugar....He added that the same was true of nearly
        all
        colonial imports....This led him to the conclusion that just as the discovery of the compass was the cause of a
        commercial revolution, the progress of chemistry was bound to bring about a counter-revolution.</p>

        [Conversation, December 1812, paraphrased by Caulaincourt] The Emperor held that the secession of these colonies
        [Mexico, Venezuela, New Granada, Chile, Argentina, etc.] was a major event that would change global politics,
        strengthen the policies of the United States, and, within ten years, threaten the power of England&mdash;all of
        which was a compensation [for the losses to Napoleonic Spain], He had no doubt that Mexico and all the other
        large
        overseas colonies of Spain were about to proclaim their independence and form one or several states under a
        constitution that would make them inclined to act as auxiliaries of the United States, as their best interests
        demanded.</p>

        [Conversation, 1816] The colonial system such as we have known it is finished for everybody&mdash;for England,
        who
        owns all the colonies, as for the other powers, who have none left. England’s mastery of the seas is no longer
        questioned. Then why, in these new circumstances, should she continue in her old routine, instead of creating a
        more advantageous political combination? England ought to anticipate a kind of emancipation of her colonies, for
        she is bound to lose a large number of them in time, and it is up to her to take advantage of the present in
        order
        to make sure of securing new ties and more favorable relationships with them. Why not induce the greater number
        of
        these colonies to buy their independence by assuming a share of the public debt? The metropolis thus would bear
        a
        lighter burden without losing any of her advantages. She would keep her ties [with the emancipated colonies] in
        the form of treaties loyally observed, of reciprocal interests, similarity of language, and the force of
        habit....What would she lose? Nothing. She would spare herself the trouble and expense of an administration
        which
        only too often earns her nothing but hatred. It is true that the cabinet ministers would have fewer jobs to hand
        out, but the nation would certainly benefit more.</p>

      <p class="p6">I am certain that, no matter how defective these raw ideas may be as I am improvising them now, it
        would be possible to turn them to good advantage by applying to them a thorough knowledge of the facts. Even

        [Deathbed
        statement, recorded by Montholon on April 17, 1821] The Emperor spent a quiet night, although he perspired
        abundantly. About three o'clock, he had me called. When I arrived, he was sitting up, and the brilliance of his
        eyes made me fear that this fever had increased. Noticing my concern, he said to me in a kindly voice:</p>

      <p class="p6">“I am not worse, but I have become preoccupied, while talking with Bertrand, about what the
        executors
        of my will are to say to my son when they see him. Bertrand doesn’t understand me. He and Lafayette are still
        exactly as they were in 1791, with their utopias, their English notions, their bills of grievances and
        States-General. All they see in the Revolution of 1789 is a mere reform of abuses, and they refuse to admit that
        it constituted, all in itself, a complete social rebirth.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">“There is nothing worse than decent people in a political crisis when their consciences are under
        the
        spell of false ideas. You will understand me: all you need do is remember the things I have dictated to you on
        the
        aims of my reign. But all this may be scattered here and there in your memory when the time comes for you to
        speak
        of it. I had better sum up in a few words the advice I leave to my son, so that you can explain my thought to
        him
        in detail. Write:</p>

      <p class="p6">“‘My son must have no thought of avenging my death: he must take advantage of it. Let him never
        forget
        my accomplishments; let him forever remain, as I have been, French to the finger tips. All his efforts must tend
        to a reign of peace. If, merely to imitate me and without an absolute necessity, he wants to resume my wars, he
        would be a mere ape. To do my labors over again would mean that I have accomplished nothing. To complete my
        work,
        on the other hand, would be to demonstrate the firmness of its foundations and to make intelligible the ground
        plan of the edifice that I had merely sketched. One cannot do the same thing twice in a century. I have been
        obliged to subdue Europe by force; today, Europe must be persuaded. I have saved the Revolution, which was on
        the
        point of death; I have washed off its crimes, I have held it up to the eyes of Europe resplendent with glory. I
        have implanted new ideas in the soil of France and Europe: their march cannot be reversed. Let my son reap the
        fruit of my seed. Let him develop all the elements of prosperity contained in the soil of France&mdash;at that
        price, he may yet become a great ruler.</p>

      <p class="p6">“‘The Bourbons will not last. When I am dead, there will be a universal reaction in my favor, even
        in
        England. That is a fine inheritance for my son. It is possible that, in order to wipe out the memory of their
        persecutions, the English will favor the return of my son to France. But in order to live on good terms with
        England, it is necessary at all costs to favor her commercial interests. This necessity entails two
        consequences:
        either fight England or share the world with her. The second alternative is the only possible one in our day.
      </p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">“‘France is the one country in which the leaders exercise the least influence; to lean on them is to
        build on quicksand. Nothing great can be accomplished in France except by leaning on the masses. Besides, a
        government must look for support where it can find it. There are moral laws that are as inflexible and imperious
        as physical laws. The Bourbons cannot find support except in the nobles and the priests, no matter what
        constitution they may be forced to adopt, just as water must find its level despite the pump that has
        temporarily
        lifted it. As for me, I always leaned on everybody without exception; I gave the first example of a government
        favoring the interests of all. I did not govern for or through the nobles, the priests, the bourgeoisie, or the
        workers. I have governed for the entire community, for the whole great French family. To keep a nation’s
        interests
        divided is a disservice to all classes and gives rise to civil war. What nature has made one cannot be divided
        but
        only mutilated.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">“‘In my youth, I had illusions. I got rid of them fast. The great orators who dominate political
        assemblies by the glitter of their words are generally the most mediocre statesmen. You must not fight them with
        words&mdash;they usually command a still more sonorous vocabulary than your own&mdash;you must counter their
        fluency with closely reasoned logic. Their strength consists in vagueness; you must lead them back to the
        reality
        of facts. Practice kills them. In the Conseil d'état there were men far more eloquent than I, but I regularly
        defeated them with this simple argument: Two and two is four.</p>

      <p class="p6">“‘France is swarming with highly capable and practical-minded men. The difficulty lies merely in
        finding them and giving them a chance to pursue their careers. There are men behind ploughs who should be in the
        Conseil d'état, and there are ministers who ought to be behind a plough.</p>

      <p class="p6">“‘My son should never be surprised at seeing the most reasonable-looking men suggest the most absurd
        plans, from agrarian reform to Oriental despotism. All systems have their apologists in France. Let him listen
        to
        everything, but also let him evaluate everything according to its true merit, and let him surround himself with
        all the true talents produced by the nation. The French people has two equally powerful passions which seem
        opposed to each other but which in fact derive from the same sentiment&mdash;love of equality and love of
        distinctions. A government cannot satisfy those two needs except by being exceedingly just. In its laws and its
        actions, the government must be the same for all; honors and rewards must be given to those men who, in the eyes
        of the government, are most worthy of them.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">“‘My son will have to reign with a free press. In our day, this is a necessity. In order to govern,
        the question is not to follow out a more or less valid theory but to build with whatever materials are at hand.
        The inevitable must be accepted and turned to advantage.</p>

      <p class="p6">“‘In the hands of the government, a free press may become a powerful ally by carrying sound
        principles
        and doctrines to the remotest corners of the Empire. To leave it to its own devices is to sleep next to a powder
        keg.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">“‘…Our enemies are the enemies of mankind. They want to put chains around the people, whom they
        regard
        as a herd. They want to oppress France and to make the river flow back to its source: let them beware lest it
        overflow! Under my son the conflicting interests can coexist in peace, and the new ideas can spread and grow in
        strength without hurt and without victims. Humanity would be spared incalculable misfortunes. But if the blind
        hatred of the kings pursues my blood after my death, I shall be avenged nonetheless&mdash;but cruelly avenged.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">“‘Civilization will be the loser in any case. If the people break their chains, Europe will be
        flooded
        with blood; civilization will disappear amid civil and foreign wars. It will take more than three hundred years
        to
        destroy, in Europe, that royal authority which only yesterday still represented the common interest but which
        required several centuries to emerge from the grip of the Middle Ages. If, on the other hand, the North [i.e.,
        Russia] should march against civilization, the struggle will be less long but the blows will be more fatal. The
        welfare of the people, all the achievements of so many years, will be lost, and no one can foresee what may be
        the
        disastrous consequences.</p>

      <p class="p6">“‘The restoration of my son is in the interest of the people as well as of the kings. Outside the
        ideas and principles for which we have fought and which I made triumph I see nothing but slavery or confusion
        for
        France and Europe alike.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">“‘Europe is marching toward an inevitable change. To retard her march is to waste strength in a
        futile
        struggle. To favor it is to strengthen the hopes and aspirations of all.</p>

      <p class="p6">“‘There are national aspirations that must be satisfied sooner or later, and toward this aim we must
        march....The serious questions will no longer be resolved in the North but in the Mediterranean: there is enough
        on its shores to satisfy the ambitions of all the powers, and with the shreds of uncivilized countries the
        happiness of the civilized nations can be bought. If only the kings would see the light, there would no longer
        be
        in Europe any cause for hatred among nations.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">“‘In order to know whether his administration is good or bad, whether his laws are in harmony with
        custom, my son should ask for a yearly report on the number of sentences passed by the tribunals, together with
        their motivations. If crimes and misdemeanors increase, this is proof that misery is on the rise and that
        society
        is badly governed. Their decrease is proof of the contrary.</p>

      <p class="p6">“‘Religious ideas have a more powerful influence than is thought by certain shortsighted
        philosophers;
        they can render great service to humanity. By being on good terms with the pope, it is possible even today to
        dominate the consciences of a hundred million men.</p>

      <p class="p5"><span class="t8">***</span></p>

      <p class="p6">“‘My son should read much history and meditate upon it: it is the only true philosophy. Let him read
        and meditate upon the wars of the great captains: it is the only way to learn the art of war.</p>

      <p class="p6">“‘Yet no matter what you say to him, no matter what he learns, he will profit little from it if in
        his
        innermost heart he lacks that sacred flame, that love of the good which alone inspires great deeds.’”</p>

        [Conversation with Rœderer, 1804, on Joseph’s ambition to be designated heir apparent to the throne] Nothing can
        wipe this from my memory. It was as if he [Joseph] had told a passionate lover that he had slept with his
        mistress, or at least that he had hopes of doing so....Power is my mistress. I have worked too hard at her
        conquest to allow anyone to take her away from me or even covet her. Although you say that power came to me of
        its
        own accord, I know what it has cost me&mdash;the sufferings, the sleepless nights, the scheming. Two weeks ago,
        I
        would not have dreamed of treating him [Joseph] unjustly. Now I am unforgiving. I shall smile at him with my

        in
        a country that has been bought at the price of blood shed in an unjust cause. It’s a phrase you might find in an
        English pamphlet. Is it up to him to write to me the way the English talk? And what’s Morfontaine, after all? It
        was bought with the blood I shed in Italy. Did he inherit the place from his father? Did he work for it? He got
        it

        made
        use of all these against me. He has betrayed me as much as he could and at the first opportunity. While I was
        away
        (<span class="t14">during the campaign in Spain)</span> he said that he had implored me on his knees to prevent
        the Spanish business&mdash;and for two years he had pestered me and urged me to undertake it. He maintained that
        twenty thousand men would be enough; he gave me twenty memoranda to prove it. He behaved exactly the same way in
        the affair of the due d’Enghien; I didn’t know that, but Talleyrand told me. (<span class="t14">The Emperor

        obtain a private audience with me. He will no longer be able to say that he has advised me in favor of or
        against
        this or that. If he is king of Spain, it’s because he wanted to be. If he had wanted to stay in Naples, he could
        have stayed. I am putting my best troops at his disposal; what is he complaining about? He thinks he is
        hindering
        me; he’s quite mistaken. Nothing will stop me. My designs will be accomplished. I possess the necessary will and
        strength. Nothing hinders me. I don’t need my family. If they are not Frenchmen, if their soul is not French, I
        have no family. At Boulogne I cast Lucien from me, because he dared speak to me like a man who wasn’t a
        Frenchman.
        They aren’t French; only I am. When I offered to make him king of Italy, he didn’t want it. In his place I
        nominated a young man, a beardless child [Eugène Beauharnais], but that child turned out to be so perfect that
        he
        even approved of my divorcing Josephine [Eugène’s mother] when the question came up, because he had a sense of
        political necessity. He [Joseph] will make me do things of which I wouldn’t have thought a year ago. If need be,

        shall adopt a general and send him to Spain [to be viceroy]. I’ll adopt Bernadotte, just as I have adopted
        Murat.
        When the king says he’ll go back to Morfontaine, does he imagine I’ll allow him to come? As soon as he declares
        himself my enemy, I shall treat him as an enemy. He is quite incapable of living in retirement. He thinks he’s
        capable of living at Morfontaine: he’s flattering himself.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer:</span> The king [Joseph] has acquired the habit of power as well as a
        liking for it&mdash;and, I believe, to say so is to praise him, for the first quality a ruler must have is to
        love
        power. At Naples, the king made his power feared and respected. All his ministers feared him, and I more than
        anybody. I was convinced that if the occasion arose I would be treated less indulgently by the king than I had
        been by Your Majesty.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> I too love power&mdash;but I love it as an artist. I love it as a
        musician loves his violin.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer:</span> If he plays it well.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> I love it for the sake of drawing sounds, chords, and harmonies
        from it. The king of Holland [Louis] also keeps talking about retiring into private life. Of us three, the one
        most capable of living at Morfontaine is I. There are two distinct persons in me&mdash;thinking man and feeling
        man. In my family circle, I am the feeling man: I play with the children, I chat with my wife, I read aloud to
        them from novels. (<span class="t14">The Emperor walks on in silence for a while.)</span> I want you to see the
        letter he wrote me. <span class="t14">(He opens the door which leads to his study and says to an usher:)</span>
        Call Monsieur Méneval [his secretary], <span class="t14">(He closes the door. A moment later the usher knocks at
          the door.</span>) Come in.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">The Usher:</span> Sire, Monsieur Méneval is not there.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Find him. (<span class="t14">Monsieur Méneval knocks at the door
          and enters a moment later.)</span> Give me the letter from the king of Spain, the big letter, you know. Bring
        also my own letter to him which preceded it and my answer to the king of Spain. (Exit <span
          class="t14">Méneval.)</span> You will be surprised at the way the king writes to me. It’s full of threats,
        insults&mdash;(<span class="t14">Monsieur Méneval brings the letters. The Emperor puts them on a chair.)</span>
      </p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer:</span> Sire, it seems to me that Your Majesty could put an immediate end
        to
        the misunderstandings that have caused these mutual reproaches. The king, it would seem, always invokes the
        Treaty
        of Bayonne [which made him king], while Your Majesty bases himself on the right of conquest, since it was
        necessary for Your Majesty to conquer Spain in order to make good the gift. Your Majesty now can impose whatever
        conditions he deems most convenient. Your Majesty has but to prescribe them, and the king&mdash;</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> I impose no other condition upon him but the one that he
        shouldn’t
        write to me the way he writes. Read his letters. <span class="t14">(The Emperor hands me the three
          letters&mdash;his own to the king, the king’s reply, and the Emperor’s reply to the king.)</span> Read all
        three
        of them aloud.<a id="calibre_link-691"></a><a href="#calibre_link-328"><span class="t16">{354}</span></a></p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">(The following is the substance of the Emperor’s letter as I recall it:)</span>
      </p>

      <p class="p6">Rœderer: “I have received your letters Nos. * * *. I do not approve of your having enlisted the
        Spanish prisoners of war sent you by Marshal Victor. The measure is imprudent and premature. Nor should you have
        amnestied the members of the Castilian junta. Those people needed a stay of four or five years in France so as
        to
        get rid of their ideas and acquire sounder ones.”</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> What I foresaw has happened: half of those regiments have
        deserted
        and have begun to loot and kill. It’s not pleasant for a general who has taken prisoners and sent them to the
        rear
        to see them return to fight him and massacre his soldiers. The king does not approve of my taking care of the
        security of my troops. Read the king’s letter.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer:</span> “Sire, I have received your dispatch dated * * *. I see with
        regret
        that everything I do earns me your displeasure. I am here without money, without aid. My guard has not received
        a
        penny since leaving Naples. Instead of the comfort and encouragement I need, I meet nothing but unpleasantness.
        My
        conduct is blamed as too indulgent by people who would be covered with ignominy if I employed against them the
        severity they want to impose on me.”</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Why doesn’t he punish disorder? Why doesn’t he repress it? He is
        my
        representative.&mdash;Go on.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer (reading):</span> “Your Majesty has ordered me to put twelve estates under
        sequestration; the order has been extended to more than twice that many.”</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> That’s Fréville’s<a id="calibre_link-692"></a><a
          href="#calibre_link-329"><span class="t16">{355}</span></a> business. It’s ridiculous how he hates Fréville.
        If
        Fréville has exceeded my orders, hasn’t he [Joseph] as much authority over him, being my representative, as over
        the generals?&mdash;Go on.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer (reading</span>): “There is not a private house in Madrid that isn’t
        either
        occupied or sealed by Your Majesty’s orders. Five or six thousand domestics are unemployed and reduced to
        begging
        or stealing.”</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Why doesn’t he call Monsieur Fréville to account? Have I ordered
        or
        authorized all this? He is making me responsible for things I never heard of.&mdash;Go on.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer:</span> “A letter has been communicated to me which orders Monsieur
        Hervas<a id="calibre_link-693"></a><a href="#calibre_link-330"><span class="t16">{356}</span></a> to spy on all
        my
        actions and to report them to Marshal Duroc.”</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> I suppose Duroc gave orders to be informed of anything touching
        my
        army. What do I care about the king’s private conduct! Did I ever know what he was doing in Naples, in private
        life? Whatever I learned about it was from his own mouth, in Venice. It’s through him I knew he was living with
        Mme * * *, by whom he had two children.&mdash;Go on.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer:</span> “Sire, I am in a most unpleasant position, without money, without
        revenues&mdash;”</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> He complains he has no money! Why hasn’t he any? There is plenty
        of
        it in Spain. I got a billion out of Prussia. It wouldn’t have been so difficult to get two billions out of
        Spain.&mdash;Go on.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer:</span> “I work from six in the morning to eleven at night. If I must be
        humiliated even in my own capital, if there is a person whom you esteem more than or as much as you do me, then
        let that person be king of Spain. I cannot accomplish anything if I lack your confidence. If I have not your
        entire confidence, I request leave to retire to Morfontaine and to lead the life of a simple private citizen.
        There I shall be able to live without remorse and with my conscience at rest.”</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Certainly there are people whom I esteem as much and more than
        him!
        It isn’t because I esteem him that I decided to put him on the throne. If I handed out crowns according to
        merit,
        I would have chosen different men. I made him king because I needed my family to consolidate my dynasty; I made
        him king because that was part of my system. He has no military ability; what he writes to me about Marshal
        Lannes
        proves it once more. Lannes asked him for troop reinforcements, and immediately he sent him two regiments of
        dragoons&mdash;assuming, he said, that since it was Marshal Lannes who asked for them, they were really needed.
        Fine reasoning! He doesn’t know that all generals&mdash;and Lannes more than the others, despite his outstanding
        bravery&mdash;always want to have more troops. Generals see only their own mission, their own army; they would
        like to collect all the troops of the country. To be sure, the two regiments may very well have been necessary
        to
        Lannes: I am criticizing the king merely for the reason that made him send them. The head of an army must
        calculate the needs of all his generals on the basis of their positions and circumstances and not let their
        requests determine his decisions....Continue the letter.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer:</span> “There [at Morfontaine] I shall be able to live without
        remorse&mdash;”</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> That’s an insult to me. He means to say that I should feel
        remorse.
        He wants to reproach me for the blood I have shed. Yes, I have shed blood, but my enemies’ blood. He’s speaking
        here like the English pamphlets. Is it up to him to talk to me like that? Did I force him to be king of Spain?
        Didn’t I leave him free to stay on in Naples?&mdash;Keep going.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer:</span> “Sire, I have reached an age at which all illusions have been
        dispelled. You still keep a little of your old friendship for me. If you do not regard me as your best, perhaps
        your only friend&mdash;”</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> What cheek! “Your best friend,” maybe&mdash;but “your only
        friend”!
        It’s an insult. I don’t accept the favor he’s bestowing on me, of being alone in loving me. I want five hundred
        million men for friends. And why does he always talk to me about his friendship? These nursemaid phrases have no
        business in our relationship. Friendship must show itself in deeds and services. My friends are those who serve
        me.&mdash;Go on.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer:</span> “I cannot stay at a post in which I no longer enjoy your
        confidence,
        or am risking its loss, and remain here to be made a fool of. I am respectfully your affectionate brother.”</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Read my reply.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Rœderer:</span> “I have received your letter No. * * *. I do not see what gave
        rise
        to the complaints it contains. I thought that it was more prudent to delay the incorporation of the prisoners
        and
        the amnesty of the junta. I hope that the future will give you no cause to regret not having thought as I did.”
      </p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> My reply, I think, is rather moderate)</p>

      <p class="p6">The following conversation took place on December 30, 1807, at Chambéry in Savoy, between Auguste de
        Staël and Napoleon. Young Auguste had come to petition the Emperor in behalf of his mother, the celebrated Mme
        de
        Staël. Her objective was twofold: to have her exile from Paris rescinded and to obtain reimbursement for the two
        million francs which her father, Jacques Necker, had lent the French treasury before his dismissal from the
        cabinet in 1790. It is curious to note that, like Marie Antoinette, Napoleon held Necker responsible for the
        French Revolution to a still greater degree than the Jacobins. The conversation is reproduced here as related in
        Bourrienne’s memoirs; Bourrienne used the account of an eyewitness, Duroc. The passages in italics are condensed
        from Bourrienne.</p>

      <p class="p6"><a id="calibre_link-694"></a><a href="#calibre_link-331"><span class="t16">{357}</span></a> <span
          class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Your grandfather [Necker] was an ideologist, a madman, a senile maniac. At the
        age
        of sixty, he wanted to overthrow my constitution and dabble in constitutional projects.<a
          id="calibre_link-695"></a><a href="#calibre_link-332"><span class="t16">{358}</span></a> It would be a nice
        state of affairs indeed if countries were governed by system mongers and theory makers who judge men from books
        and the world from a map!</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">De Staël:</span> Sire, since the projects my grandfather proposed are merely vain
        theories in the eyes of Your Majesty, I do not understand why Your Majesty is so exercised on their account.
        Every
        economist has written projects for a constitution.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Yes, I should think so! Economists! They are empty dreamers who
        think up financial systems and who are not fit to be tax collectors in the least village of my Empire. Your
        grandfather’s book is the work of a stubborn old man who on his deathbed still kept twaddling about the
        government
        of nations.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">De Staël:</span> Sire, from the manner in which Your Majesty speaks of the book, I
        may perhaps be excused for thinking that Your Majesty has been informed by ill-intentioned people and has not
        read
        it.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> That’s where you’re wrong. I’ve read it myself from cover to
        cover.
      </p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">De Staël:</span> Then Your Majesty must have seen how much tribute my grandfather
        rendered to Your Majesty’s genius.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Yes! Some tribute! He called me the “necessary man”! The
        necessary
        man! And, to listen to him, the first thing that ought to have been done was to cut the throat of the necessary
        man. Yes, I was necessary, indispensable, in order to repair all the stupidities of your grandfather, to root
        out
        all the evil he had done to France. It was he who overthrew the monarchy and led Louis XVI to the scaffold.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">De Staël:</span> Sire, you cannot help knowing that it was because he defended the
        king that my grandfather’s property was confiscated.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Defended the king! A fine defense, by God! Monsieur de Staël! If
        I
        gave a man poison, and then, when he was in his agony, I brought him the antidote, would you say that I wanted
        to
        save that man? Well, that’s how your grandfather defended Louis XVI. As for the confiscated property you
        mention,
        what does that prove? Nothing. Robespierre’s property was confiscated too. Yes, I’m telling you, even
        Robespierre,
        Marat, Danton have done less harm to France than Monsieur Necker. It’s he who made the Revolution. You were too
        young then. Well, I was there. I saw what the Reign of Terror was like, and the public calamities of the times.
        But so long as I live, these times won’t come back, you may take my word for it. Your planners are putting
        utopias
        on paper. There are imbeciles who read those daydreams; they are circulated, they are believed, everybody talks
        about universal welfare. Then comes a famine, the people rise in rebellion, and there you have the fruit of your
        fine theories! It’s your grandfather who was the cause of the Saturnalia that devastated France. All the blood
        that has been shed in the Revolution is on his hands.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">De Staël</span> <span class="t14">(mastering his emotion</span>): Sire, allow me
        to
        hope that posterity will judge my grandfather more favorably than does Your Majesty. During his administration
        he
        was compared to Sully and Colbert, and I repeat to Your Majesty that in my opinion posterity will speak more
        justly of him.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Yes, yes&mdash;posterity! Maybe it won’t speak about him at all.
      </p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">De Staël:</span> I dare hope the contrary, Sire.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon</span> <span class="t14">(turning toward his staff and smiling):</span>
        In
        the last analysis, gentlemen, it isn’t really up to me to speak ill of the Revolution, since I ended up by
        snatching the throne. (<span class="t14">To</span> <span class="t14">De Staël)</span>: The reign of the
        troublemakers is finished. What I want is subordination. Respect authority, because it comes from God. You are
        young and well brought up. Follow a better road, get yourself used to subordination. Don’t follow those evil
        principles which, for the sake of idle talking, compromise the very existence of society.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">De Staël:</span> Sire, since it is my good fortune that Your Majesty does me the
        honor of finding me well brought up, Your Majesty must not condemn the principles of my grandfather and my
        mother,
        for it was with their principles that I was raised.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Well, I’m advising you to keep straight in politics, for I shall
        not forgive the least thing to anyone connected with Monsieur Necker. Everybody must keep straight in politics.
      </p>

      <p class="p6">(<span class="t14">This entire conversation took place while Napoleon and his staff were at table.
          At
          the words, “Everybody must keep straight in politics,” the Emperor rose, while Monsieur de Staël still
          insisted
          on obtaining the repeal of his mother’s exile. Without replying to his renewed pleas, the Emperor stepped up
          to
          him and took him by the ear.)</span></p>

      <p class="p6">Napoleon: You are very young. If you had my age and experience, you would judge things better. Far
        from offending me, your frankness has pleased me. I like a son who pleads his mother’s cause. Your mother has
        sent
        you on a difficult errand, and you have acquitted yourself intelligently. I am glad to have talked with you; I
        like young people when they are simple and not too argumentative. Despite all this, I don’t want to give you any
        false hopes, and I cannot help telling you that you will obtain nothing. Murat has already spoken to me on that
        matter, and I told him, as I am telling you now, that my will is unshakable. If your mother were in prison, I
        shouldn’t hesitate to grant you her pardon&mdash;but she’s in exile, and nothing will make me call her back.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">De Staël:</span> But, Your Majesty, is not exile from one’s fatherland and friends
        as painful as prison?</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> Romantic notions, all this: you must have picked that up from
        your
        mother. She’s much to be pitied indeed! Except for Paris, all Europe is her prison.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">De Staël:</span> But, Sire, her friends are all in Paris.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> With her clever mind, she’ll be able to make friends elsewhere.
        Besides, I cannot understand why she is so intent on coming to Paris. Why is she so eager to place herself
        within
        immediate reach of my tyranny? You see, I’m not afraid of the word. Truth to tell, I don’t understand her. Can’t
        she go to Rome, to Berlin, to Vienna, to Milan, to London? That’s it&mdash;let her go to London. She can write
        pamphlets against me there, if she wants to. I shall be glad if she goes to any of those places, but
        Paris&mdash;don’t you see, Monsieur de Staël?&mdash;Paris is the place where I have my residence, and I don’t
        want
        anybody there who doesn’t like me. This goes for everyone who knows what’s good for him....Your mother would
        promise miracles, but she won’t be able to keep from talking politics.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">De Staël:</span> But, Sire, Your Majesty may rest assured that my mother is no
        longer interested in politics; her inclinations are entirely to her friends and to literature.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">Napoleon:</span> That’s what it is! Literature, is it? I won’t be taken in by
        this.
        You can make politics by talking literature, morality, arts, anything. Women should be knitting....</p>

      <p class="p6">[The conversation proceeded much on the same tone for several more minutes until the Emperor
        dismissed
        his petitioner with these gracious words:] I don’t advise you at all [to settle in France], Go to England. There
        they love the Genevese, the quibblers and drawing-room politicians. Go to England, for I am warning you that in
        France I’ll be against you rather than for you.</p>

      <p class="p6"><span class="t14">(After this conversation, the Emperor without a word entered his coach and
          remained
          sunk in thought for several miles. When he broke his silence, he said to Duroc:)</span> Wasn’t I a little hard
        on that young man?...I’m afraid I was. Well, I’m glad of it, all things considered. Others won’t try it again.
        Those people disparage everything I do. They don’t understand me.</p>

        and
        said, “Madame de Clermont-Tonnerre, what do you think of me?” It was a difficult and delicate matter to reply to
        so sudden an apostrophe. “Why, general,” she said after a moment’s hesitation, “I think you are like a clever

        building behind a scaffolding that you will take down when you have finished.”&mdash;”Yes, Madam, that’s exactly

        [Conversation, 1816] I have closed the gaping abyss of anarchy, and I have unscrambled chaos. I have cleansed
        the

        competition, I have rewarded merit wherever I found it, I have pushed back the boundaries of greatness. All
        this,
        you must admit, is something. Is there any point on which I could be attacked and on which a historian could not
        take up my defense? My intentions, perhaps? He has evidence enough to clear me. My despotism? He can prove that
        dictatorship was absolutely necessary. Will it be said that I restricted freedom? He will be able to prove that
        licence, anarchy, and general disorder were still on our doorstep. Shall I be accused of having loved war too
        much? He will show that I was always on the defensive. That I wanted to set up a universal monarchy? He will
        explain that it was merely the fortuitous result of circumstances and that I was led to it step by step by our

        grandest and noblest, perhaps, that ever was: the ambition of establishing and consecrating at last the kingdom
        of
        reason and the full exercise, the complete enjoyment, of all human capabilities! And in this respect the
        historian
        will perhaps find himself forced to regret that such an ambition has not been fulfilled, has not been satisfied.

        Savona with Piedmont; the Pont d’Iéna, Pont d’Austerlitz, and Pont des Arts [three bridges in Paris]; the
        bridges
        at Sèvres, Tours, Roanne, Lyons, Turin, Bordeaux, Rouen; the bridges across the Isère and the Durance, etc.; the

        the

        restoration of most of the churches destroyed in the Revolution and the building of new ones; the creation of
        numerous industrial establishments to wipe out begging; the enlargement of the Louvre and the construction of
        public granaries, of the Bank of France, of the Ourcq canal; the municipal water system in Paris; the numerous

        furnishings in the Crown’s palaces in France, Holland, Turin, and Rome; sixty millions’ worth of crown diamonds,
        all bought with Napoleon’s money, including even the “Regent,” which he recovered from the Jews of Berlin, to
        whom
        it had been pawned for three millions; the Musée Napoléon [i.e., the Louvre], whose worth is estimated at more
        than four hundred million francs and which contains nothing but objects legitimately acquired, either by

        or by virtue of peace treaties...; several millions economized [to constitute a fund] for the encouragement of

        much credit for it; indeed, I don’t see how it could have been reasonably possible to act otherwise. But if

        only
        at a congress of kings, surrounded by sovereigns whom I had either persuaded or mastered. Then, and then only,
        could I have profitably displayed Washington’s moderation, disinterestedness, and wisdom. In all reason, I could

        that made this campaign so famous, we said to the Emperor that he must have derived great pleasure from it.
        “None

        “this kind of happiness can scarcely be known in today’s France except as tradition has passed it on. The
        Revolution has overturned everything; it has deprived the older generation of that happiness, and the new
        generation has never known it. What I just pictured no longer exists.” And he then made the following

      <p class="p6">BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES on all persons named in this volume would form another volume. The following
        entries have been limited to (l) those contemporaries of Napoleon whose identification may contribute to the
        understanding of the text and (2) those named as reporters of his conversations. They exclude (1) those
        sufficiently identified in the context, in bracketed additions, or in footnotes and (2) well-known personalities
        not part of Napoleon’s entourage.</p>

      <p class="p6">Abell, Mrs., <span class="t14">see</span> Balcombe.</p>

      <p class="p6">Antommarchi, Francesco, 17897-1838, Napoleon’s physician on Saint Helena from 1819 to his death, a

      <p class="p6">Balcombe, William, 1779-1829, official of the East India Company on Saint Helena and purveyor to
        Napoleon’s household. Napoleon resided at his estate, “The Briars,” October-December 1815. His daughter, Betsy
        Balcombe (Mrs. Abell), c. 1802-1871, was a favorite of Napoleon, who played rough games with her. She left
        spirited memoirs.</p>

      <p class="p6">Beauharnais, Eugène, 1781-1824, son of Empress Josephine by her first marriage. He served ably as
        general under Napoleon, who adopted him and made him viceroy of Italy (1805-14).</p>

      <p class="p6">Beauharnais, Hortense, 1783-1837, daughter of Empress Josephine by her first marriage. Napoleon
        married her to his brother Louis. She was queen of Holland (from 1806 until Louis’s abdication in 1810) and the
        mother of Napoleon III.</p>

      <p class="p6">Beauharnais, Josephine, <span class="t14">see</span> Josephine.</p>

      <p class="p6">Bernadotte, Jean Baptiste Jules, 1764-1844, marshal of France, as Charles XIV king of Sweden and
        Norway (1818-44). The husband of Désirée Clary, sister of Joseph Bonaparte’s wife Julie, he was a member of the
        imperial family and was created prince of Pontecorvo before his adoption (1810) by Charles XIII as heir to the
        Swedish throne. The king left the conduct of government to him, and in 1813 Bernadotte tipped the scales against
        Napoleon by joining the Allies.</p>

      <p class="p6">Berthier, Louis Alexandre, 1753-1815, marshal of France, Napoleon’s chief of staff from 1796 to

      <p class="p6">Bonaparte, Caroline, 1782-1839, sister of Napoleon. She married Murat <span
          class="t14">(q.v.)</span>
        in 1800. As queen of Naples (1808-15) she intrigued against her brother.</p>

      <p class="p6">Bonaparte, Hortense, <span class="t14">see</span> Beauharnais, Hortense.</p>

      <p class="p6">Bonaparte, Jérôme, 1784-1860, Napoleon’s youngest brother. As a young navy officer he met and
        married
        (1803) Elizabeth Patterson in Baltimore. Napoleon had the marriage annulled, married him to Princess Catherine
        of
        Württemberg, and made him king of Westphalia (1807-13). Jérôme distinguished himself by his irresponsible and
        flamboyant expenditures.</p>

      <p class="p6">Bonaparte, Joseph, 1768-1844, Napoleon’s elder brother. Napoleon employed him on important
        diplomatic
        missions and made him king of Naples (1806-8) and of Spain (1808-13). He showed little ability in any of his
        posts
        and frequently attracted his brother’s ire. After 1815 Joseph lived mainly at his estate at Bordentown, N.J.</p>

      <p class="p6">Bonaparte, Letizia, 1750-1836, Napoleon’s mother, “Madame Mère.”</p>

      <p class="p6">Bonaparte, Louis, 1778-1846, brother of Napoleon, who married him to Hortense Beauharnais and made
        him
        king of Holland in 1806. A bad husband but a conscientious ruler, he favored Dutch against French interests and
        was generally popular. Threatened with war by his hectoring brother, he abdicated in 1810 and fled to Austria.
        He
        was the father of Napoleon III.</p>

      <p class="p6">Bonaparte, Lucien, 1775-1840, brother of Napoleon. As president of the Council of Five Hundred he
        took
        a decisive part in helping Napoleon to power on 18 Brumaire (1799). He then served as minister of the interior
        and
        as ambassador to Spain, but his unauthorized marriage to a divorcée in 1803 precipitated a violent break with
        Napoleon. Lucien retired to Italy and was created prince of Canino by the pope. During the Hundred Days (1815)
        he
        returned to France and supported Napoleon.</p>

      <p class="p6">Borghese, Camillo, Prince, 1775-1832, Roman nobleman, second husband of Napoleon’s sister Pauline.

        private
        secretary (1797-1802). His financial transactions caused a break with the First Consul. Bourrienne’s memoirs,
        largely ghostwritten from his notes, are more reliable for the earlier than the later parts.</p>

      <p class="p6">Cambacérès, Jean Jacques Régis de, 1753-1824, French jurist. He took an important part in the French
        Revolution, became Second Consul after 18 Brumaire (1799), arehchancellor (1804), and minister of justice

        by
        Napoleon. He was ambassador to Russia (1807-11) and in 1812 vainly sought to dissuade Napoleon from his Russian
        campaign. He accompanied Napoleon on his return from Russia to Paris and was foreign minister in 1814 and 1815.
        His memoirs, published in 1933, are among the most interesting and reliable of the period.</p>

      <p class="p6">Chaptal [de Chantéloup], Jean Antoine, comte, 1756-1832, French scientist and economist, minister of
        the interior (1801-4). He was a pioneer in applied chemistry and planned many of the public works undertaken by

          class="t14">Le Génie du christianisme, Atala, René,</span> and <span class="t14">Mémoires d’outretombe.</span>
        An émigré, he returned to France during the Consulate and at first supported Bonaparte, who gave him diplomatic
        posts. He broke with Napoleon after the execution of the duc d’Enghien (1804) and played a major political role
        under the restored Bourbons. In his memoirs he did justice to Napoleon’s greatness.</p>

      <p class="p6">Constant, Benjamin, 1767-1830, French writer and politician, born at Lausanne, Switzerland. Long the
        lover of Mme de Staël <span class="t14">(q.v.),</span> he was a leader of the opposition in the Tribunate until
        his expulsion (1801), welcomed the Bourbons in 1814, but was enticed by Napoleon in 1815 to support him on his
        return from Elba. He was the chief framer of the Acte Additionnel, by which the constitution was liberalized.
      </p>

        author of the <span class="t14">Mémorial,</span> which was to become the gospel of Napoleon worshipers.
        Regardless
        of its shortcomings, the <span class="t14">Mémorial</span> is a precious record of Napoleon’s conversations.</p>

      <p class="p6">Lebrun, Charles François, 1739-1824, French politician. He was Third Consul (1799-1804) and governor

      <h1 class="h"><a id="calibre_link-1144"></a><a id="calibre_link-1145"></a><a id="calibre_link-237"></a>SOURCES AND
        NOTES</h1>

      <p class="p6">THE LIST BELOW by no means represents the full canon of Napoleon’s written or spoken words. It
        merely
        lists the sources actually used in this collection.</p>

      <p class="p6">The Notes following the list of sources are grouped by numerals. Each numeral corresponds to the
        figure preceding a group of selections in the text, from 1 through 340. Information supplied between square
        brackets at the head of selections has not been repeated in the Notes except where necessary for clarity. All
        references in the Notes are in abbreviated form; full data can be found in the list of sources. Thus, the source
        reference to the last selection under No. 64 reads: Ségur, I, 251. The Ségur entry in the list fills in the
        details.</p>

      <p class="p6">The combination of bracketed information in the text, Sources, and Notes is intended to supply all
        necessary information.</p>

      <p class="p6">In the case of Las Cases’s <span class="t14">Mémorial,</span> of which there are many editions, the
        usual method of citing by volume and page has been abandoned; instead, the date of entry used in the <span
          class="t14">Mémorial</span> is given as reference for the passage quoted. (The reader must be warned that the
        date of the entry in the <span class="t14">Mémorial</span> is not necessarily the date on which Napoleon made
        the
        statement quoted.)</p>

      <p class="p6">The titles of Napoleon’s own writings, which vary in the different editions, are generally given as
        they appear in the edition cited.</p>

          directed his guns to fire on the ice. However, Friedrich von Kircheisen, one of Napoleon’s most authoritative
          biographers, states firmly that the entire incident is a pure invention</span> <span class="t24">(Napoleon I.:

          it
          really is. It was meant to answer a rumor that Napoleon was dead, a rumor which only a few days earlier had
          led
          to an abortive coup d’état in Paris. It was the news of that coup which determined Napoleon to make his dash
